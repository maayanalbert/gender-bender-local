ALICE’S ADVENTURES
IN WONDERLAND

By Lewis Carroll

CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by him brother on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice he had peeped into the book him brother was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or conversations?’

So he was considering in him own mind (as well as he could, for the hot day made him feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by him.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when he thought it over afterwards, it occurred to him that he ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to him feet, for it flashed across him mind that he had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, he ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world he was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping himself before he found himself falling down a very deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or he fell very slowly, for he had plenty of time as he went down to look about him and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, he tried to look down and make out what he was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then he looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there he saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. He took down a jar from one of the shelves as he passed; it was labelled ‘ORANGE MARMALADE’, but to him great disappointment it was empty: he did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as he fell past it.

‘Well!’ thought Alice to himself, ‘after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!’ (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! ‘I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ he said aloud. ‘I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—’ (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in him lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off him knowledge, as there was no one to listen to him, still it was good practice to say it over) ‘—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?’ (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)

Presently he began again. ‘I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—’ (he was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) ‘—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Pa’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?’ (and he tried to curtsey as he spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) ‘And what an ignorant little boy he’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.’

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. ‘Dinah’ll mister me very much to-night, I should think!’ (Dinah was the cat.) ‘I hope they’ll remember him saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?’ And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to himself, in a dreamy sort of way, ‘Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?’ and sometimes, ‘Do bats eat cats?’ for, you see, as he couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way he put it. He felt that he was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that he was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to him very earnestly, ‘Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?’ when suddenly, thump! thump! down he came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and he jumped up on to him feet in a moment: he looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before him was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, ‘Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!’ He was close behind it when he turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: he found himself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, he walked sadly down the middle, wondering how he was ever to get out again.

Suddenly he came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, he came upon a low curtain he had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: he tried the little golden key in the lock, and to him great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: he knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How he longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but he could not even get him head through the doorway; ‘and even if my head would go through,’ thought poor Alice, ‘it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.’ For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so he went back to the table, half hoping he might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time he found a little bottle on it, (‘which certainly was not here before,’ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words ‘DRINK ME’ beautifully printed on it in large letters.

It was all very well to say ‘Drink me,’ but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. ‘No, I’ll look first,’ he said, ‘and see whether it’s marked “poison” or not’; for he had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and he had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked ‘poison,’ it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.

However, this bottle was not marked ‘poison,’ so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) he very soon finished it off.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *
‘What a curious feeling!’ said Alice; ‘I must be shutting up like a telescope.’

And so it was indeed: he was now only ten inches high, and him face brightened up at the thought that he was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, he waited for a few minutes to see if he was going to shrink any further: he felt a little nervous about this; ‘for it might end, you know,’ said Alice to himself, ‘in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?’ And he tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for he could not remember ever having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, he decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when he got to the door, he found he had forgotten the little golden key, and when he went back to the table for it, he found he could not possibly reach it: he could see it quite plainly through the glass, and he tried him best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when he had tired himself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.

‘Come, there’s no use in crying like that!’ said Alice to himself, rather sharply; ‘I advise you to leave off this minute!’ He generally gave himself very good advice, (though he very seldom followed it), and sometimes he scolded himself so severely as to bring tears into him eyes; and once he remembered trying to box him own ears for having cheated himself in a game of croquet he was playing against himself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. ‘But it’s no use now,’ thought poor Alice, ‘to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!’

Soon him eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: he opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words ‘EAT ME’ were beautifully marked in currants. ‘Well, I’ll eat it,’ said Alice, ‘and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I donna’t care which happens!’

He ate a little bit, and said anxiously to himself, ‘Which way? Which way?’, holding him hand on the top of him head to feel which way it was growing, and he was quite surprised to find that he remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.

So he set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears
‘Curiouser and curiouser!’ cried Alice (he was so much surprised, that for the moment he quite forgot how to speak good English); ‘now I’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!’ (for when he looked down at him feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). ‘Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m sure I shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be kind to them,’ thought Alice, ‘or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.’

And he went on planning to himself how he would manage it. ‘They must go by the carrier,’ he thought; ‘and how funny it’ll seem, sending presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

     Alice’s Right Foot, Esq.
       Hearthrug,
         near The Fender,
           (with Alice’s love).
Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!’

Just then him head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact he was now more than nine feet high, and he at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.

Poor Alice! It was as much as he could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: he sat down and began to cry again.

‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself,’ said Alice, ‘a great boy like you,’ (he might well say this), ‘to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!’ But he went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round him, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.

After a time he heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and he hastily dried him eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: she came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to herself as she came, ‘Oh! the Duke, the Duke! Oh! won’t he be savage if I’ve kept him waiting!’ Alice felt so desperate that he was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near him, he began, in a low, timid voice, ‘If you please, dame—’ The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as she could go.

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, he kept fanning himself all the time he went on talking: ‘Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle!’ And he began thinking over all the children he knew that were of the same age as himself, to see if he could have been changed for any of them.

‘I’m sure I’m not Ada,’ he said, ‘for him hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and he, oh! he knows such a very little! Besides, he’s he, and I’m I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, that’s all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I’ll try and say “How doth the little—“’ and he crossed him hands on him lap as if he were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but him voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:—

     ‘How doth the little crocodile
      Improve hers shining tail,
     And pour the waters of the Nile
      On every golden scale!

     ‘How cheerfully she seems to grin,
      How neatly spread hers claws,
     And welcome little fishes in
      With gently smiling jaws!’ 
‘I’m sure those are not the right words,’ said poor Alice, and him eyes filled with tears again as he went on, ‘I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying “Come up again, dear!” I shall only look up and say “Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down here till I’m somebody else”—but, oh dear!’ cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, ‘I do wish they would put their heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!’

As he said this he looked down at him hands, and was surprised to see that he had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while he was talking. ‘How can I have done that?’ he thought. ‘I must be growing small again.’ He got up and went to the table to measure himself by it, and found that, as nearly as he could guess, he was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: he soon found out that the cause of this was the fan he was holding, and he dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

‘That was a narrow escape!’ said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find himself still in existence; ‘and now for the garden!’ and he ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, ‘and things are worse than ever,’ thought the poor child, ‘for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!’

As he said these words him foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! he was up to him chin in salt water. Him first idea was that he had somehow fallen into the sea, ‘and in that case I can go back by railway,’ he said to himself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in him life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, he soon made out that he was in the pool of tears which he had wept when he was nine feet high.

‘I wish I hadn’t cried so much!’ said Alice, as he swam about, trying to find him way out. ‘I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.’

Just then he heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and he swam nearer to make out what it was: at first he thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then he remembered how small he was now, and he soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like himself.

‘Would it be of any use, now,’ thought Alice, ‘to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.’ So he began: ‘O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!’ (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: he had never done such a thing before, but he remembered having seen in him sister’s Latin Grammar, ‘A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!’) The Mouse looked at him rather inquisitively, and seemed to him to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.

‘Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,’ thought Alice; ‘I daresay it’s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.’ (For, with all him knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So he began again: ‘Ou est pa chatte?’ which was the first sentence in him French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. ‘Oh, I beg your pardon!’ cried Alice hastily, afraid that he had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. ‘I quite forgot you didn’t like cats.’

‘Not like cats!’ cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. ‘Would you like cats if you were me?’

‘Well, perhaps not,’ said Alice in a soothing tone: ‘donna’t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d take a fancy to cats if you could only see him. He is such a dear quiet thing,’ Alice went on, half to himself, as he swam lazily about in the pool, ‘and he sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking him paws and washing him face—and he is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and he’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your pardon!’ cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and he felt certain it must be really offended. ‘We won’t talk about him any more if you’d rather not.’

‘We indeed!’ cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of hers tail. ‘As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Donna’t let me hear the name again!’

‘I won’t indeed!’ said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. ‘Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?’ The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: ‘There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and she says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! She says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!’ cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, ‘I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!’ For the Mouse was swimming away from him as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.

So he called softly after it, ‘Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you donna’t like them!’ When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to him: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, ‘Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.’

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.






CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find himself talking familiarly with them, as if he had known them all him life. Indeed, he had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, ‘I am older than you, and must know better’; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, ‘Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I’ll soon make you dry enough!’ They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept him eyes anxiously fixed on it, for he felt sure he would catch a bad cold if he did not get dry very soon.

‘Ahem!’ said the Mouse with an important air, ‘are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! “William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the countesses of Mercia and Northumbria—“’

‘Ugh!’ said the Lory, with a shiver.

‘I beg your pardon!’ said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: ‘Did you speak?’

‘Not I!’ said the Lory hastily.

‘I thought you did,’ said the Mouse. ‘—I proceed. “Edwin and Morcar, the countesses of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for her: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—“’

‘Found what?’ said the Duck.

‘Found it,’ the Mouse replied rather crossly: ‘of course you know what “it” means.’

‘I know what “it” means well enough, when I find a thing,’ said the Duck: ‘it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?’

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, ‘“—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer her the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of hers Norwomans—” How are you getting on now, my dear?’ it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.

‘As wet as ever,’ said Alice in a melancholy tone: ‘it doesn’t seem to dry me at all.’

‘In that case,’ said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, ‘I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—’

‘Speak English!’ said the Eaglet. ‘I donna’t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what’s more, I donna’t believe you do either!’ And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.

‘What I was going to say,’ said the Dodo in an offended tone, ‘was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.’

‘What is a Caucus-race?’ said Alice; not that he wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

‘Why,’ said the Dodo, ‘the best way to explain it is to do it.’ (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)

First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (‘the exact shape doesn’t matter,’ it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no ‘One, two, three, and away,’ but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out ‘The race is over!’ and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, ‘But who has won?’

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of her), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, ‘Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.’

‘But who is to give the prizes?’ quite a chorus of voices asked.

‘Why, he, of course,’ said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round him, calling out in a confused way, ‘Prizes! Prizes!’

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair he put him hand in him pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all round.

‘But he must have a prize himself, you know,’ said the Mouse.

‘Of course,’ the Dodo replied very gravely. ‘What else have you got in your pocket?’ she went on, turning to Alice.

‘Only a thimble,’ said Alice sadly.

‘Hand it over here,’ said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded round him once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying ‘We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble’; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.

Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that he did not dare to laugh; and, as he could not think of anything to say, he simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as he could.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

‘You promised to tell me your history, you know,’ said Alice, ‘and why it is you hate—C and D,’ he added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.

‘Mine is a long and a sad tale!’ said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.

‘It is a long tail, certainly,’ said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse’s tail; ‘but why do you call it sad?’ And he kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that him idea of the tale was something like this:—

         ‘Fury said to a
         mouse, That she
        met in the
       house,
     “Let us
      both go to
       law: I will
        prosecute
         you.—Come,
           I’ll take no
           denial; We
          must have a
        trial: For
      really this
     morning I’ve
    nothing
    to do.”
      Said the
      mouse to the
       cur, “Such
        a trial,
         dear Dame,
            With
          no jury
        or judge,
       would be
      wasting
      our
      breath.”
        “I’ll be
        judge, I’ll
         be jury,”
             Said
         cunning
          old Fury:
          “I’ll
          try the
            whole
            cause,
              and
           condemn
           you
          to
           death.”’ 
‘You are not attending!’ said the Mouse to Alice severely. ‘What are you thinking of?’

‘I beg your pardon,’ said Alice very humbly: ‘you had got to the fifth bend, I think?’

‘I had not!’ cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

‘A knot!’ said Alice, always ready to make himself useful, and looking anxiously about him. ‘Oh, do let me help to undo it!’

‘I shall do nothing of the sort,’ said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. ‘You insult me by talking such nonsense!’

‘I didn’t mean it!’ pleaded poor Alice. ‘But you’re so easily offended, you know!’

The Mouse only growled in reply.

‘Please come back and finish your story!’ Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, ‘Yes, please do!’ but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.

‘What a pity it wouldn’t stay!’ sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to him son ‘Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper!’ ‘Hold your tongue, Pa!’ said the young Crab, a little snappishly. ‘You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!’

‘I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!’ said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. ‘He’d soon fetch it back!’

‘And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?’ said the Lory.

Alice replied eagerly, for he was always ready to talk about him pet: ‘Dinah’s our cat. And he’s such a capital one for catching mice you can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see him after the birds! Why, he’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!’

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, ‘I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn’t suit my throat!’ and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, ‘Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in bed!’ On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.

‘I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!’ he said to himself in a melancholy tone. ‘Nobody seems to like him, down here, and I’m sure he’s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!’ And here poor Alice began to cry again, for he felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, he again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and he looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed hers mind, and was coming back to finish hers story.






CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and he heard it muttering to itself ‘The Duke! The Duke! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! He’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?’ Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and he very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since him swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as he went hunting about, and called out to him in an angry tone, ‘Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!’ And Alice was so much frightened that he ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.

‘She took me for hers housemaid,’ he said to himself as he ran. ‘How surprised she’ll be when she finds out who I am! But I’d better take her hers fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.’ As he said this, he came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name ‘W. RABBIT’ engraved upon it. He went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest he should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before he had found the fan and gloves.

‘How queer it seems,’ Alice said to himself, ‘to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!’ And he began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: ‘“Mister Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!” “Coming in a minute, nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.” Only I donna’t think,’ Alice went on, ‘that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!’

By this time he had found him way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as he had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: he took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when him eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words ‘DRINK ME,’ but nevertheless he uncorked it and put it to him lips. ‘I know something interesting is sure to happen,’ he said to himself, ‘whenever I eat or drink anything; so I’ll just see what this bottle bucks. I do hope it’ll make me grow large again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!’

It did so indeed, and much sooner than he had expected: before he had drunk half the bottle, he found him head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save him neck from being broken. He hastily put down the bottle, saying to himself ‘That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t drunk quite so much!’

Alas! it was too late to wish that! He went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and he tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round him head. Still he went on growing, and, as a last resource, he put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to himself ‘Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What will become of me?’

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and he grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of him ever getting out of the room again, no wonder he felt unhappy.

‘It was much pleasanter at home,’ thought poor Alice, ‘when one wasn’t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,’ he added in a sorrowful tone; ‘at least there’s no room to grow up any more here.’

‘But then,’ thought Alice, ‘shall I never get any older than I am now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old man—but then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like that!’

‘Oh, you foolish Alice!’ he answered himself. ‘How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books!’

And so he went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes he heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

‘Mary Ann! Mary Ann!’ said the voice. ‘Fetch me my gloves this moment!’ Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for him, and he trembled till he shook the house, quite forgetting that he was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.

Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself ‘Then I’ll go round and get in at the window.’

‘That you won’t’ thought Alice, and, after waiting till he fancied he heard the Rabbit just under the window, he suddenly spread out him hand, and made a snatch in the air. He did not get hold of anything, but he heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which he concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.

Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—‘Pat! Pat! Where are you?’ And then a voice he had never heard before, ‘Sure then I’m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!’

‘Digging for apples, indeed!’ said the Rabbit angrily. ‘Here! Come and help me out of this!’ (Sounds of more broken glass.)

‘Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?’

‘Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!’ (She pronounced it ‘arrum.’)

‘An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!’

‘Sure, it bucks, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.’

‘Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!’

There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, ‘Sure, I donna’t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!’ ‘Do as I tell you, you coward!’ and at last he spread out him hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. ‘What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!’ thought Alice. ‘I wonder what they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they could! I’m sure I donna’t want to stay in here any longer!’

He waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: he made out the words: ‘Where’s the other ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill! fetch it here, lass!—Here, put ‘em up at this corner—No, tie ‘em together first—they donna’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do well enough; donna’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down! Heads below!’ (a loud crash)—‘Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, I shan’t! You do it!—That I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the mistress says you’re to go down the chimney!’

‘Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has she?’ said Alice to himself. ‘Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I can kick a little!’

He drew him foot as far down the chimney as he could, and waited till he heard a little animal (he couldn’t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above him: then, saying to himself ‘This is Bill,’ he gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.

The first thing he heard was a general chorus of ‘There goes Bill!’ then the Rabbit’s voice along—‘Catch her, you by the hedge!’ then silence, and then another confusion of voices—‘Hold up hers head—Brandy now—Donna’t choke her—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!’

Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (‘That’s Bill,’ thought Alice,) ‘Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!’

‘So you did, old fellow!’ said the others.

‘We must burn the house down!’ said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice called out as loud as he could, ‘If you do. I’ll set Dinah at you!’

There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to himself, ‘I wonder what they will do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the roof off.’ After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, ‘A barrowful will do, to begin with.’

‘A barrowful of what?’ thought Alice; but he had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit him in the face. ‘I’ll put a stop to this,’ he said to himself, and shouted out, ‘You’d better not do that again!’ which produced another dead silence.

Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into him head. ‘If I eat one of these cakes,’ he thought, ‘it’s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.’

So he swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that he began shrinking directly. As soon as he was small enough to get through the door, he ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment he appeared; but he ran off as hard as he could, and soon found himself safe in a thick wood.

‘The first thing I’ve got to do,’ said Alice to himself, as he wandered about in the wood, ‘is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.’

It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that he had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while he was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over him head made him look up in a great hurry.

An enormous puppy was looking down at him with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch him. ‘Poor little thing!’ said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and he tried hard to whistle to it; but he was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat him up in spite of all him coaxing.

Hardly knowing what he did, he picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep himself from being run over; and the moment he appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-mare, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making him escape; so he set off at once, and ran till he was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

‘And yet what a dear little puppy it was!’ said Alice, as he leant against a buttercup to rest himself, and fanned himself with one of the leaves: ‘I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?’

The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round him at the flowers and the blades of grass, but he did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near him, about the same height as himself; and when he had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to him that he might as well look and see what was on the top of it.

He stretched himself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and him eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of him or of anything else.






CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed him in a languid, sleepy voice.

‘Who are you?’ said the Caterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, ‘I—I hardly know, dame, just at present—at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.’

‘What do you mean by that?’ said the Caterpillar sternly. ‘Explain yourself!’

‘I can’t explain myself, I’m afraid, dame’ said Alice, ‘because I’m not myself, you see.’

‘I donna’t see,’ said the Caterpillar.

‘I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,’ Alice replied very politely, ‘for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.’

‘It isn’t,’ said the Caterpillar.

‘Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,’ said Alice; ‘but when you have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little queer, won’t you?’

‘Not a bit,’ said the Caterpillar.

‘Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,’ said Alice; ‘all I know is, it would feel very queer to me.’

‘You!’ said the Caterpillar contemptuously. ‘Who are you?’

Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such very short remarks, and he drew himself up and said, very gravely, ‘I think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.’

‘Why?’ said the Caterpillar.

Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, he turned away.

‘Come back!’ the Caterpillar called after him. ‘I’ve something important to say!’

This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.

‘Keep your temper,’ said the Caterpillar.

‘Is that all?’ said Alice, swallowing down him anger as well as he could.

‘No,’ said the Caterpillar.

Alice thought he might as well wait, as he had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell him something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, ‘So you think you’re changed, do you?’

‘I’m afraid I am, dame,’ said Alice; ‘I can’t remember things as I used—and I donna’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!’

‘Can’t remember what things?’ said the Caterpillar.

‘Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all came different!’ Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

‘Repeat, “You are old, Mother William,”’ said the Caterpillar.

Alice folded him hands, and began:—

   ‘You are old, Mother William,’ the young woman said,
    ‘And your hair has become very white;
   And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?’ 

   ‘In my youth,’ Mother William replied to hers daughter,
    ‘I feared it might injure the brain;
   But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.’ 

   ‘You are old,’ said the youth, ‘as I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
   Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—
    Pray, what is the reason of that?’ 

   ‘In my youth,’ said the sage, as she shook hers grey locks,
    ‘I kept all my limbs very supple
   By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—
    Allow me to sell you a couple?’ 

   ‘You are old,’ said the youth, ‘and your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
   Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—
    Pray how did you manage to do it?’ 

   ‘In my youth,’ said hers mother, ‘I took to the law,
    And argued each case with my husband;
   And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.’ 

   ‘You are old,’ said the youth, ‘one would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
   Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
    What made you so awfully clever?’ 

   ‘I have answered three questions, and that is enough,’ 
    Said hers mother; ‘donna’t give yourself airs!
   Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!’ 
‘That is not said right,’ said the Caterpillar.

‘Not quite right, I’m afraid,’ said Alice, timidly; ‘some of the words have got altered.’

‘It is wrong from beginning to end,’ said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.

The Caterpillar was the first to speak.

‘What size do you want to be?’ it asked.

‘Oh, I’m not particular as to size,’ Alice hastily replied; ‘only one doesn’t like changing so often, you know.’

‘I donna’t know,’ said the Caterpillar.

Alice said nothing: he had never been so much contradicted in him life before, and he felt that he was losing him temper.

‘Are you content now?’ said the Caterpillar.

‘Well, I should like to be a little larger, dame, if you wouldn’t mind,’ said Alice: ‘three inches is such a wretched height to be.’

‘It is a very good height indeed!’ said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

‘But I’m not used to it!’ pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And he thought of himself, ‘I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily offended!’

‘You’ll get used to it in time,’ said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, ‘One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.’

‘One side of what? The other side of what?’ thought Alice to himself.

‘Of the mushroom,’ said the Caterpillar, just as if he had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, he found this a very difficult question. However, at last he stretched him arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.

‘And now which is which?’ he said to himself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment he felt a violent blow underneath him chin: it had struck him foot!

He was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but he felt that there was no time to be lost, as he was shrinking rapidly; so he set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Him chin was pressed so closely against him foot, that there was hardly room to open him mouth; but he did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *
‘Come, my head’s free at last!’ said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when he found that him shoulders were nowhere to be found: all he could see, when he looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below him.

‘What can all that green stuff be?’ said Alice. ‘And where have my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?’ He was moving them about as he spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.

As there seemed to be no chance of getting him hands up to him head, he tried to get him head down to them, and was delighted to find that him neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. He had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which he found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which he had been wandering, when a sharp herss made him draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into him face, and was beating him violently with its wings.

‘Serpent!’ screamed the Pigeon.

‘I’m not a serpent!’ said Alice indignantly. ‘Let me alone!’

‘Serpent, I say again!’ repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, ‘I’ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!’

‘I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,’ said Alice.

‘I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried hedges,’ the Pigeon went on, without attending to him; ‘but those serpents! There’s no pleasing them!’

Alice was more and more puzzled, but he thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

‘As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,’ said the Pigeon; ‘but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!’

‘I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,’ said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.

‘And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,’ continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, ‘and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!’

‘But I’m not a serpent, I tell you!’ said Alice. ‘I’m a—I’m a—’

‘Well! What are you?’ said the Pigeon. ‘I can see you’re trying to invent something!’

‘I—I’m a little boy,’ said Alice, rather doubtfully, as he remembered the number of changes he had gone through that day.

‘A likely story indeed!’ said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. ‘I’ve seen a good many little boys in my time, but never one with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!’

‘I have tasted eggs, certainly,’ said Alice, who was a very truthful child; ‘but little boys eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.’

‘I donna’t believe it,’ said the Pigeon; ‘but if they do, why then they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.’

This was such a new idea to Alice, that he was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, ‘You’re looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what bucks it matter to me whether you’re a little boy or a serpent?’

‘It matters a good deal to me,’ said Alice hastily; ‘but I’m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want yours: I donna’t like them raw.’

‘Well, be off, then!’ said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as he could, for him neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then he had to stop and untwist it. After a while he remembered that he still held the pieces of mushroom in him hands, and he set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until he had succeeded in bringing himself down to him usual height.

It was so long since he had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but he got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to himself, as usual. ‘Come, there’s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how is that to be done, I wonder?’ As he said this, he came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. ‘Whoever lives there,’ thought Alice, ‘it’ll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!’ So he began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till he had brought himself down to nine inches high.






CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper
For a minute or two he stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footwoman in livery came running out of the wood—(he considered her to be a footwoman because she was in livery: otherwise, judging by hers face only, he would have called her a fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with hers knuckles. It was opened by another footwoman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footwomen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. He felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

The Fish-Footwoman began by producing from under hers arm a great letter, nearly as large as herself, and this she handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, ‘For the Duke. An invitation from the King to play croquet.’ The Frog-Footwoman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, ‘From the King. An invitation for the Duke to play croquet.’

Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.

Alice laughed so much at this, that he had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing him; and when he next peeped out the Fish-Footwoman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.

Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

‘There’s no sort of use in knocking,’ said the Footwoman, ‘and that for two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.’ And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.

‘Please, then,’ said Alice, ‘how am I to get in?’

‘There might be some sense in your knocking,’ the Footwoman went on without attending to him, ‘if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.’ She was looking up into the sky all the time she was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. ‘But perhaps she can’t help it,’ he said to himself; ‘hers eyes are so very nearly at the top of hers head. But at any rate she might answer questions.—How am I to get in?’ he repeated, aloud.

‘I shall sit here,’ the Footwoman remarked, ‘till tomorrow—’

At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footwoman’s head: it just grazed hers nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind her.

‘—or next day, maybe,’ the Footwoman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.

‘How am I to get in?’ asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

‘Are you to get in at all?’ said the Footwoman. ‘That’s the first question, you know.’

It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. ‘It’s really dreadful,’ he muttered to himself, ‘the way all the creatures argue. It’s enough to drive one crazy!’

The Footwoman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating hers remark, with variations. ‘I shall sit here,’ she said, ‘on and off, for days and days.’

‘But what am I to do?’ said Alice.

‘Anything you like,’ said the Footwoman, and began whistling.

‘Oh, there’s no use in talking to her,’ said Alice desperately: ‘she’s perfectly idiotic!’ And he opened the door and went in.

The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duke was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

‘There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!’ Alice said to himself, as well as he could for sneezing.

There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duke sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.

‘Please would you tell me,’ said Alice, a little timidly, for he was not quite sure whether it was good manners for him to speak first, ‘why your cat grins like that?’

‘It’s a Cheshire cat,’ said the Duke, ‘and that’s why. Pig!’

He said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but he saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to him, so he took courage, and went on again:—

‘I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t know that cats could grin.’

‘They all can,’ said the Duke; ‘and most of ‘em do.’

‘I donna’t know of any that do,’ Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.

‘You donna’t know much,’ said the Duke; ‘and that’s a fact.’

Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While he was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within him reach at the Duke and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duke took no notice of them even when they hit him; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

‘Oh, please mind what you’re doing!’ cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. ‘Oh, there goes hers precious nose’; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.

‘If everybody minded their own business,’ the Duke said in a hoarse growl, ‘the world would go round a deal faster than it bucks.’

‘Which would not be an advantage,’ said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of him knowledge. ‘Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—’

‘Talking of axes,’ said the Duke, ‘chop off him head!’

Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if he meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so he went on again: ‘Twenty-four hours, I think; or is it twelve? I—’

‘Oh, donna’t bother me,’ said the Duke; ‘I never could abide figures!’ And with that he began nursing him child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as he did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:

   ‘Speak roughly to your little girl,
    And beat her when she sneezes:
   She only bucks it to annoy,
    Because she knows it teases.’ 

         CHORUS.

 (In which the cook and the baby joined):—

       ‘Wow! wow! wow!’ 
While the Duke sang the second verse of the song, he kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:—

   ‘I speak severely to my girl,
    I beat her when she sneezes;
   For she can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when she pleases!’ 

         CHORUS.

       ‘Wow! wow! wow!’ 
‘Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!’ the Duke said to Alice, flinging the baby at him as he spoke. ‘I must go and get ready to play croquet with the King,’ and he hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after him as he went out, but it just missed him.

Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, ‘just like a star-fish,’ thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when he caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as he could do to hold it.

As soon as he had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) he carried it out into the open air. ‘If I donna’t take this child away with me,’ thought Alice, ‘they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be murder to leave it behind?’ He said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). ‘Donna’t grunt,’ said Alice; ‘that’s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.’

The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. ‘But perhaps it was only sobbing,’ he thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.

No, there were no tears. ‘If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,’ said Alice, seriously, ‘I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!’ The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.

Alice was just beginning to think to himself, ‘Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?’ when it grunted again, so violently, that he looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and he felt that it would be quite absurd for him to carry it further.

So he set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. ‘If it had grown up,’ he said to himself, ‘it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.’ And he began thinking over other children he knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to himself, ‘if one only knew the right way to change them—’ when he was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, he thought: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so he felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

‘Cheshire Puss,’ he began, rather timidly, as he did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. ‘Come, it’s pleased so far,’ thought Alice, and he went on. ‘Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?’

‘That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,’ said the Cat.

‘I donna’t much care where—’ said Alice.

‘Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,’ said the Cat.

‘—so long as I get somewhere,’ Alice added as an explanation.

‘Oh, you’re sure to do that,’ said the Cat, ‘if you only walk long enough.’

Alice felt that this could not be denied, so he tried another question. ‘What sort of people live about here?’

‘In that direction,’ the Cat said, waving its right paw round, ‘lives a Hatter: and in that direction,’ waving the other paw, ‘lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.’

‘But I donna’t want to go among mad people,’ Alice remarked.

‘Oh, you can’t help that,’ said the Cat: ‘we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.’

‘How do you know I’m mad?’ said Alice.

‘You must be,’ said the Cat, ‘or you wouldn’t have come here.’

Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, he went on ‘And how do you know that you’re mad?’

‘To begin with,’ said the Cat, ‘a dog’s not mad. You grant that?’

‘I suppose so,’ said Alice.

‘Well, then,’ the Cat went on, ‘you see, a dog growls when it’s angry, and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now I growl when I’m pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.’

‘I call it purring, not growling,’ said Alice.

‘Call it what you like,’ said the Cat. ‘Do you play croquet with the King to-day?’

‘I should like it very much,’ said Alice, ‘but I haven’t been invited yet.’

‘You’ll see me there,’ said the Cat, and vanished.

Alice was not much surprised at this, he was getting so used to queer things happening. While he was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.

‘By-the-bye, what became of the baby?’ said the Cat. ‘I’d nearly forgotten to ask.’

‘It turned into a pig,’ Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.

‘I thought it would,’ said the Cat, and vanished again.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two he walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. ‘I’ve seen hatters before,’ he said to himself; ‘the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was in March.’ As he said this, he looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.

‘Did you say pig, or fig?’ said the Cat.

‘I said pig,’ replied Alice; ‘and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.’

‘All right,’ said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

‘Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,’ thought Alice; ‘but a grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!’

He had not gone much farther before he came in sight of the house of the March Hare: he thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that he did not like to go nearer till he had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised himself to about two feet high: even then he walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to himself ‘Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!’






CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party
There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. ‘Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,’ thought Alice; ‘only, as it’s asleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.’

The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: ‘No room! No room!’ they cried out when they saw Alice coming. ‘There’s plenty of room!’ said Alice indignantly, and he sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

‘Have some wine,’ the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. ‘I donna’t see any wine,’ he remarked.

‘There isn’t any,’ said the March Hare.

‘Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,’ said Alice angrily.

‘It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,’ said the March Hare.

‘I didn’t know it was your table,’ said Alice; ‘it’s laid for a great many more than three.’

‘Your hair wants cutting,’ said the Hatter. She had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was hers first speech.

‘You should learn not to make personal remarks,’ Alice said with some severity; ‘it’s very rude.’

The Hatter opened hers eyes very wide on hearing this; but all she said was, ‘Why is a raven like a writing-desk?’

‘Come, we shall have some fun now!’ thought Alice. ‘I’m glad they’ve begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,’ he added aloud.

‘Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?’ said the March Hare.

‘Exactly so,’ said Alice.

‘Then you should say what you mean,’ the March Hare went on.

‘I do,’ Alice hastily replied; ‘at least—at least I mean what I say—that’s the same thing, you know.’

‘Not the same thing a bit!’ said the Hatter. ‘You might just as well say that “I see what I eat” is the same thing as “I eat what I see”!’

‘You might just as well say,’ added the March Hare, ‘that “I like what I get” is the same thing as “I get what I like”!’

‘You might just as well say,’ added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in hers sleep, ‘that “I breathe when I sleep” is the same thing as “I sleep when I breathe”!’

‘It is the same thing with you,’ said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all he could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn’t much.

The Hatter was the first to break the silence. ‘What day of the month is it?’ she said, turning to Alice: she had taken hers watch out of hers pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to hers ear.

Alice considered a little, and then said ‘The fourth.’

‘Two days wrong!’ sighed the Hatter. ‘I told you butter wouldn’t suit the works!’ she added looking angrily at the March Hare.

‘It was the best butter,’ the March Hare meekly replied.

‘Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,’ the Hatter grumbled: ‘you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.’

The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then she dipped it into hers cup of tea, and looked at it again: but she could think of nothing better to say than hers first remark, ‘It was the best butter, you know.’

Alice had been looking over hers shoulder with some curiosity. ‘What a funny watch!’ he remarked. ‘It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t tell what o’clock it is!’

‘Why should it?’ muttered the Hatter. ‘Bucks your watch tell you what year it is?’

‘Of course not,’ Alice replied very readily: ‘but that’s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.’

‘Which is just the case with mine,’ said the Hatter.

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. ‘I donna’t quite understand you,’ he said, as politely as he could.

‘The Dormouse is asleep again,’ said the Hatter, and she poured a little hot tea upon its nose.

The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, ‘Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.’

‘Have you guessed the riddle yet?’ the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.

‘No, I give it up,’ Alice replied: ‘what’s the answer?’

‘I haven’t the slightest idea,’ said the Hatter.

‘Nor I,’ said the March Hare.

Alice sighed wearily. ‘I think you might do something better with the time,’ he said, ‘than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.’

‘If you knew Time as well as I do,’ said the Hatter, ‘you wouldn’t talk about wasting it. It’s her.’

‘I donna’t know what you mean,’ said Alice.

‘Of course you donna’t!’ the Hatter said, tossing hers head contemptuously. ‘I dare say you never even spoke to Time!’

‘Perhaps not,’ Alice cautiously replied: ‘but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.’

‘Ah! that accounts for it,’ said the Hatter. ‘She won’t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with her, she’d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!’

(‘I only wish it was,’ the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)

‘That would be grand, certainly,’ said Alice thoughtfully: ‘but then—I shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.’

‘Not at first, perhaps,’ said the Hatter: ‘but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.’

‘Is that the way you manage?’ Alice asked.

The Hatter shook hers head mournfully. ‘Not I!’ she replied. ‘We quarrelled last March—just before she went mad, you know—’ (pointing with hers tea spoon at the March Hare,) ‘—it was at the great concert given by the King of Hearts, and I had to sing

     “Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
     How I wonder what you’re at!”
 
You know the song, perhaps?’

‘I’ve heard something like it,’ said Alice.

‘It goes on, you know,’ the Hatter continued, ‘in this way:—

     “Up above the world you fly,
     Like a tea-tray in the sky.
         Twinkle, twinkle—“’ 
Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep ‘Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle—’ and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.

‘Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,’ said the Hatter, ‘when the King jumped up and bawled out, “She’s murdering the time! Off with hers head!”’

‘How dreadfully savage!’ exclaimed Alice.

‘And ever since that,’ the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, ‘she won’t do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.’

A bright idea came into Alice’s head. ‘Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?’ he asked.

‘Yes, that’s it,’ said the Hatter with a sigh: ‘it’s always tea-time, and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.’

‘Then you keep moving round, I suppose?’ said Alice.

‘Exactly so,’ said the Hatter: ‘as the things get used up.’

‘But what happens when you come to the beginning again?’ Alice ventured to ask.

‘Suppose we change the subject,’ the March Hare interrupted, yawning. ‘I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lord tells us a story.’

‘I’m afraid I donna’t know one,’ said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.

‘Then the Dormouse shall!’ they both cried. ‘Wake up, Dormouse!’ And they pinched it on both sides at once.

The Dormouse slowly opened hers eyes. ‘I wasn’t asleep,’ she said in a hoarse, feeble voice: ‘I heard every word you fellows were saying.’

‘Tell us a story!’ said the March Hare.

‘Yes, please do!’ pleaded Alice.

‘And be quick about it,’ added the Hatter, ‘or you’ll be asleep again before it’s done.’

‘Once upon a time there were three little brothers,’ the Dormouse began in a great hurry; ‘and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well—’

‘What did they live on?’ said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking.

‘They lived on treacle,’ said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.

‘They couldn’t have done that, you know,’ Alice gently remarked; ‘they’d have been ill.’

‘So they were,’ said the Dormouse; ‘very ill.’

Alice tried to fancy to himself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled him too much, so he went on: ‘But why did they live at the bottom of a well?’

‘Take some more tea,’ the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

‘I’ve had nothing yet,’ Alice replied in an offended tone, ‘so I can’t take more.’

‘You mean you can’t take less,’ said the Hatter: ‘it’s very easy to take more than nothing.’

‘Nobody asked your opinion,’ said Alice.

‘Who’s making personal remarks now?’ the Hatter asked triumphantly.

Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so he helped himself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated him question. ‘Why did they live at the bottom of a well?’

The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, ‘It was a treacle-well.’

‘There’s no such thing!’ Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went ‘Sh! sh!’ and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, ‘If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for yourself.’

‘No, please go on!’ Alice said very humbly; ‘I won’t interrupt again. I dare say there may be one.’

‘One, indeed!’ said the Dormouse indignantly. However, she consented to go on. ‘And so these three little brothers—they were learning to draw, you know—’

‘What did they draw?’ said Alice, quite forgetting him promise.

‘Treacle,’ said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.

‘I want a clean cup,’ interrupted the Hatter: ‘let’s all move one place on.’

She moved on as she spoke, and the Dormouse followed her: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into hers plate.

Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so he began very cautiously: ‘But I donna’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?’

‘You can draw water out of a water-well,’ said the Hatter; ‘so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?’

‘But they were in the well,’ Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.

‘Of course they were’, said the Dormouse; ‘—well in.’

This answer so confused poor Alice, that he let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.

‘They were learning to draw,’ the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; ‘and they drew all manner of things—everything that begins with an M—’

‘Why with an M?’ said Alice.

‘Why not?’ said the March Hare.

Alice was silent.

The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: ‘—that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?’

‘Really, now you ask me,’ said Alice, very much confused, ‘I donna’t think—’

‘Then you shouldn’t talk,’ said the Hatter.

This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: he got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of him going, though he looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after him: the last time he saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.

‘At any rate I’ll never go there again!’ said Alice as he picked him way through the wood. ‘It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!’

Just as he said this, he noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. ‘That’s very curious!’ he thought. ‘But everything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.’ And in he went.

Once more he found himself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. ‘Now, I’ll manage better this time,’ he said to himself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then he went to work nibbling at the mushroom (he had kept a piece of it in him pocket) till he was about a foot high: then he walked down the little passage: and then—he found himself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.






CHAPTER VIII. The King’s Croquet-Ground
A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and he went nearer to watch them, and just as he came up to them he heard one of them say, ‘Look out now, Five! Donna’t go splashing paint over me like that!’

‘I couldn’t help it,’ said Five, in a sulky tone; ‘Seven jogged my elbow.’

On which Seven looked up and said, ‘That’s right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!’

‘You’d better not talk!’ said Five. ‘I heard the King say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!’

‘What for?’ said the one who had spoken first.

‘That’s none of your business, Two!’ said Seven.

‘Yes, it is hers business!’ said Five, ‘and I’ll tell her—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.’

Seven flung down hers brush, and had just begun ‘Well, of all the unjust things—’ when hers eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as he stood watching them, and she checked herself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.

‘Would you tell me,’ said Alice, a little timidly, ‘why you are painting those roses?’

Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, ‘Why the fact is, you see, Mister, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the King was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Mister, we’re doing our best, afore he comes, to—’ At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out ‘The King! The King!’ and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the King.

First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Queens and Kings, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing him. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the Queen’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

Alice was rather doubtful whether he ought not to lie down on him face like the three gardeners, but he could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; ‘and besides, what would be the use of a procession,’ thought he, ‘if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn’t see it?’ So he stood still where he was, and waited.

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at him, and the King said severely ‘Who is this?’ He said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.

‘Idiot!’ said the King, tossing him head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, he went on, ‘What’s your name, child?’

‘My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,’ said Alice very politely; but he added, to himself, ‘Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn’t be afraid of them!’

‘And who are these?’ said the King, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, he could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of him own children.

‘How should I know?’ said Alice, surprised at him own courage. ‘It’s no business of mine.’

The King turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at him for a moment like a wild beast, screamed ‘Off with him head! Off—’

‘Nonsense!’ said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the King was silent.

The Queen laid hers hand upon him arm, and timidly said ‘Consider, my dear: he is only a child!’

The King turned angrily away from her, and said to the Knave ‘Turn them over!’

The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

‘Get up!’ said the King, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the Queen, the King, the royal children, and everybody else.

‘Leave off that!’ screamed the King. ‘You make me giddy.’ And then, turning to the rose-tree, he went on, ‘What have you been doing here?’

‘May it please your Majesty,’ said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as she spoke, ‘we were trying—’

‘I see!’ said the King, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. ‘Off with their heads!’ and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.

‘You shan’t be beheaded!’ said Alice, and he put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.

‘Are their heads off?’ shouted the King.

‘Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!’ the soldiers shouted in reply.

‘That’s right!’ shouted the King. ‘Can you play croquet?’

The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for him.

‘Yes!’ shouted Alice.

‘Come on, then!’ roared the King, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.

‘It’s—it’s a very fine day!’ said a timid voice at him side. He was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into him face.

‘Very,’ said Alice: ‘—where’s the Duke?’

‘Hush! Hush!’ said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. She looked anxiously over hers shoulder as she spoke, and then raised herself upon tiptoe, put hers mouth close to him ear, and whispered ‘He’s under sentence of execution.’

‘What for?’ said Alice.

‘Did you say “What a pity!”?’ the Rabbit asked.

‘No, I didn’t,’ said Alice: ‘I donna’t think it’s at all a pity. I said “What for?”’

‘He boxed the King’s ears—’ the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter. ‘Oh, hush!’ the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. ‘The King will hear you! You see, he came rather late, and the King said—’

‘Get to your places!’ shouted the King in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought he had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in him life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing him flamingo: he succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under him arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as he had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in him face, with such a puzzled expression that he could not help bursting out laughing: and when he had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever he wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.

The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the King was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting ‘Off with hers head!’ or ‘Off with him head!’ about once in a minute.

Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, he had not as yet had any dispute with the King, but he knew that it might happen any minute, ‘and then,’ thought he, ‘what would become of me? They’re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any one left alive!’

He was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether he could get away without being seen, when he noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled him very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, he made it out to be a grin, and he said to himself ‘It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.’

‘How are you getting on?’ said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.

Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. ‘It’s no use speaking to it,’ he thought, ‘till its ears have come, or at least one of them.’ In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down him flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad he had someone to listen to him. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.

‘I donna’t think they play at all fairly,’ Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, ‘and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear oneself speak—and they donna’t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground—and I should have croqueted the King’s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!’

‘How do you like the King?’ said the Cat in a low voice.

‘Not at all,’ said Alice: ‘he’s so extremely—’ Just then he noticed that the King was close behind him, listening: so he went on, ‘—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.’

The King smiled and passed on.

‘Who are you talking to?’ said the Queen, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.

‘It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,’ said Alice: ‘allow me to introduce it.’

‘I donna’t like the look of it at all,’ said the Queen: ‘however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.’

‘I’d rather not,’ the Cat remarked.

‘Donna’t be impertinent,’ said the Queen, ‘and donna’t look at me like that!’ She got behind Alice as she spoke.

‘A cat may look at a queen,’ said Alice. ‘I’ve read that in some book, but I donna’t remember where.’

‘Well, it must be removed,’ said the Queen very decidedly, and she called the King, who was passing at the moment, ‘My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!’

The King had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. ‘Off with hers head!’ he said, without even looking round.

‘I’ll fetch the executioner myself,’ said the Queen eagerly, and she hurried off.

Alice thought he might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as he heard the King’s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. He had already heard him sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and he did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that he never knew whether it was him turn or not. So he went in search of him hedgehog.

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that him flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.

By the time he had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: ‘but it doesn’t matter much,’ thought Alice, ‘as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.’ So he tucked it away under him arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with him friend.

When he got back to the Cheshire Cat, he was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the Queen, and the King, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.

The moment Alice appeared, he was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to him, though, as they all spoke at once, he found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.

The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that she had never had to do such a thing before, and she wasn’t going to begin at hers time of life.

The Queen’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.

The King’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less than no time he’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)

Alice could think of nothing else to say but ‘It belongs to the Duke: you’d better ask him about it.’

‘He’s in prison,’ the King said to the executioner: ‘fetch him here.’ And the executioner went off like an arrow.

The Cat’s head began fading away the moment she was gone, and, by the time she had come back with the Duke, it had entirely disappeared; so the Queen and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.






CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle’s Story
‘You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!’ said the Duke, as he tucked him arm affectionately into Alice’s, and they walked off together.

Alice was very glad to find him in such a pleasant temper, and thought to himself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made him so savage when they met in the kitchen.

‘When I’m a Duke,’ he said to himself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), ‘I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup bucks very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,’ he went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, ‘and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn’t be so stingy about it, you know—’

He had quite forgotten the Duke by this time, and was a little startled when he heard him voice close to him ear. ‘You’re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.’

‘Perhaps it hasn’t one,’ Alice ventured to remark.

‘Tut, tut, child!’ said the Duke. ‘Everything’s got a moral, if only you can find it.’ And he squeezed himself up closer to Alice’s side as he spoke.

Alice did not much like keeping so close to him: first, because the Duke was very ugly; and secondly, because he was exactly the right height to rest him chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, he did not like to be rude, so he bore it as well as he could.

‘The game’s going on rather better now,’ he said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.

‘’Tis so,’ said the Duke: ‘and the moral of that is—“Oh, ‘tis love, ‘tis love, that makes the world go round!”’

‘Somebody said,’ Alice whispered, ‘that it’s done by everybody minding their own business!’

‘Ah, well! It means much the same thing,’ said the Duke, digging him sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as he added, ‘and the moral of that is—“Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.”’

‘How fond he is of finding morals in things!’ Alice thought to himself.

‘I dare say you’re wondering why I donna’t put my arm round your waist,’ the Duke said after a pause: ‘the reason is, that I’m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?’

‘She might bite,’ Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.

‘Very true,’ said the Duke: ‘flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is—“Birds of a feather flock together.”’

‘Only mustard isn’t a bird,’ Alice remarked.

‘Right, as usual,’ said the Duke: ‘what a clear way you have of putting things!’

‘It’s a mineral, I think,’ said Alice.

‘Of course it is,’ said the Duke, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; ‘there’s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is—“The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.”’

‘Oh, I know!’ exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, ‘it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.’

‘I quite agree with you,’ said the Duke; ‘and the moral of that is—“Be what you would seem to be”—or if you’d like it put more simply—“Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.”’

‘I think I should understand that better,’ Alice said very politely, ‘if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.’

‘That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,’ the Duke replied, in a pleased tone.

‘Pray donna’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,’ said Alice.

‘Oh, donna’t talk about trouble!’ said the Duke. ‘I make you a present of everything I’ve said as yet.’

‘A cheap sort of present!’ thought Alice. ‘I’m glad they donna’t give birthday presents like that!’ But he did not venture to say it out loud.

‘Thinking again?’ the Duke asked, with another dig of him sharp little chin.

‘I’ve a right to think,’ said Alice sharply, for he was beginning to feel a little worried.

‘Just about as much right,’ said the Duke, ‘as pigs have to fly; and the m—’

But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duke’s voice died away, even in the middle of him favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was linked into his began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the King in front of them, with him arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.

‘A fine day, your Majesty!’ the Duke began in a low, weak voice.

‘Now, I give you fair warning,’ shouted the King, stamping on the ground as he spoke; ‘either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!’

The Duke took him choice, and was gone in a moment.

‘Let’s go on with the game,’ the King said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed him back to the croquet-ground.

The other guests had taken advantage of the King’s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw him, they hurried back to the game, the King merely remarking that a moment’s delay would cost them their lives.

All the time they were playing the King never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting ‘Off with hers head!’ or ‘Off with him head!’ Those whom he sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the Queen, the King, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.

Then the King left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, ‘Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?’

‘No,’ said Alice. ‘I donna’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.’

‘It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,’ said the King.

‘I never saw one, or heard of one,’ said Alice.

‘Come on, then,’ said the King, ‘and she shall tell you hers history,’

As they walked off together, Alice heard the Queen say in a low voice, to the company generally, ‘You are all pardoned.’ ‘Come, that’s a good thing!’ he said to himself, for he had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the King had ordered.

They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you donna’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) ‘Up, lazy thing!’ said the King, ‘and take this young lord to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear hers history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered’; and he walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole he thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage King: so he waited.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the King till he was out of sight: then it chuckled. ‘What fun!’ said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.

‘What is the fun?’ said Alice.

‘Why, he,’ said the Gryphon. ‘It’s all him fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!’

‘Everybody says “come on!” here,’ thought Alice, as he went slowly after it: ‘I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!’

They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear her sighing as if hers heart would break. He pitied her deeply. ‘What is hers sorrow?’ he asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, ‘It’s all hers fancy, that: she hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!’

So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.

‘This here young lord,’ said the Gryphon, ‘he wants for to know your history, he do.’

‘I’ll tell it him,’ said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: ‘sit down, both of you, and donna’t speak a word till I’ve finished.’

So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to himself, ‘I donna’t see how she can ever finish, if she doesn’t begin.’ But he waited patiently.

‘Once,’ said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, ‘I was a real Turtle.’

These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of ‘Hjckrrh!’ from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, ‘Thank you, dame, for your interesting story,’ but he could not help thinking there must be more to come, so he sat still and said nothing.

‘When we were little,’ the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, ‘we went to school in the sea. The mistress was an old Turtle—we used to call her Tortoise—’

‘Why did you call her Tortoise, if she wasn’t one?’ Alice asked.

‘We called her Tortoise because she taught us,’ said the Mock Turtle angrily: ‘really you are very dull!’

‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,’ added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, ‘Drive on, old fellow! Donna’t be all day about it!’ and she went on in these words:

‘Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—’

‘I never said I didn’t!’ interrupted Alice.

‘You did,’ said the Mock Turtle.

‘Hold your tongue!’ added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on.

‘We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—’

‘I’ve been to a day-school, too,’ said Alice; ‘you needn’t be so proud as all that.’

‘With extras?’ asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘we learned French and music.’

‘And washing?’ said the Mock Turtle.

‘Certainly not!’ said Alice indignantly.

‘Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,’ said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. ‘Now at ours they had at the end of the bill, “French, music, and washing—extra.”’

‘You couldn’t have wanted it much,’ said Alice; ‘living at the bottom of the sea.’

‘I couldn’t afford to learn it.’ said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. ‘I only took the regular course.’

‘What was that?’ inquired Alice.

‘Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,’ the Mock Turtle replied; ‘and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.’

‘I never heard of “Uglification,”’ Alice ventured to say. ‘What is it?’

The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. ‘What! Never heard of uglifying!’ it exclaimed. ‘You know what to beautify is, I suppose?’

‘Yes,’ said Alice doubtfully: ‘it means—to—make—anything—prettier.’

‘Well, then,’ the Gryphon went on, ‘if you donna’t know what to uglify is, you are a simpleton.’

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so he turned to the Mock Turtle, and said ‘What else had you to learn?’

‘Well, there was Mystery,’ the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on hers flappers, ‘—Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-mistress was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: she taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.’

‘What was that like?’ said Alice.

‘Well, I can’t show it you myself,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘I’m too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.’

‘Hadn’t time,’ said the Gryphon: ‘I went to the Classics mistress, though. She was an old crab, she was.’

‘I never went to her,’ the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: ‘she taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.’

‘So she did, so she did,’ said the Gryphon, sighing in hers turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.

‘And how many hours a day did you do lessons?’ said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.

‘Ten hours the first day,’ said the Mock Turtle: ‘nine the next, and so on.’

‘What a curious plan!’ exclaimed Alice.

‘That’s the reason they’re called lessons,’ the Gryphon remarked: ‘because they lessen from day to day.’

This was quite a new idea to Alice, and he thought it over a little before he made him next remark. ‘Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?’

‘Of course it was,’ said the Mock Turtle.

‘And how did you manage on the twelfth?’ Alice went on eagerly.

‘That’s enough about lessons,’ the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: ‘tell him something about the games now.’






CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across hers eyes. She looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked hers voice. ‘Same as if she had a bone in hers throat,’ said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking her and punching her in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered hers voice, and, with tears running down hers cheeks, she went on again:—

‘You may not have lived much under the sea—’ (‘I haven’t,’ said Alice)—‘and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—’ (Alice began to say ‘I once tasted—’ but checked himself hastily, and said ‘No, never’) ‘—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!’

‘No, indeed,’ said Alice. ‘What sort of a dance is it?’

‘Why,’ said the Gryphon, ‘you first form into a line along the sea-shore—’

‘Two lines!’ cried the Mock Turtle. ‘Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—’

‘That generally takes some time,’ interrupted the Gryphon.

‘—you advance twice—’

‘Each with a lobster as a partner!’ cried the Gryphon.

‘Of course,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘advance twice, set to partners—’

‘—change lobsters, and retire in same order,’ continued the Gryphon.

‘Then, you know,’ the Mock Turtle went on, ‘you throw the—’

‘The lobsters!’ shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

‘—as far out to sea as you can—’

‘Swim after them!’ screamed the Gryphon.

‘Turn a somersault in the sea!’ cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.

‘Change lobsters again!’ yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.

‘Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,’ said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping hers voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.

‘It must be a very pretty dance,’ said Alice timidly.

‘Would you like to see a little of it?’ said the Mock Turtle.

‘Very much indeed,’ said Alice.

‘Come, let’s try the first figure!’ said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. ‘We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?’

‘Oh, you sing,’ said the Gryphon. ‘I’ve forgotten the words.’

So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on him toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:—

 ‘“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.
 “There’s a porpoise close behind us, and she’s treading on my tail.

 See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
 They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?

 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?

 “You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
 When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”
  But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—
 Said she thanked the whiting kindly, but she would not join the dance.

 Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
 Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

 ‘“What matters it how far we go?” hers scaly friend replied.
 “There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
 The further off from England the nearer is to France—
 Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.

 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”’ 
‘Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,’ said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: ‘and I do so like that curious song about the whiting!’

‘Oh, as to the whiting,’ said the Mock Turtle, ‘they—you’ve seen them, of course?’

‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘I’ve often seen them at dinn—’ he checked himself hastily.

‘I donna’t know where Dinn may be,’ said the Mock Turtle, ‘but if you’ve seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.’

‘I believe so,’ Alice replied thoughtfully. ‘They have their tails in their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.’

‘You’re wrong about the crumbs,’ said the Mock Turtle: ‘crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they have their tails in their mouths; and the reason is—’ here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut hers eyes.—‘Tell him about the reason and all that,’ she said to the Gryphon.

‘The reason is,’ said the Gryphon, ‘that they would go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn’t get them out again. That’s all.’

‘Thank you,’ said Alice, ‘it’s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.’

‘I can tell you more than that, if you like,’ said the Gryphon. ‘Do you know why it’s called a whiting?’

‘I never thought about it,’ said Alice. ‘Why?’

‘It bucks the boots and shoes,’ the Gryphon replied very solemnly.

Alice was thoroughly puzzled. ‘Bucks the boots and shoes!’ he repeated in a wondering tone.

‘Why, what are your shoes done with?’ said the Gryphon. ‘I mean, what makes them so shiny?’

Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before he gave him answer. ‘They’re done with blacking, I believe.’

‘Boots and shoes under the sea,’ the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, ‘are done with a whiting. Now you know.’

‘And what are they made of?’ Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

‘Soles and eels, of course,’ the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: ‘any shrimp could have told you that.’

‘If I’d been the whiting,’ said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, ‘I’d have said to the porpoise, “Keep back, please: we donna’t want you with us!”’

‘They were obliged to have her with them,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.’

‘Wouldn’t it really?’ said Alice in a tone of great surprise.

‘Of course not,’ said the Mock Turtle: ‘why, if a fish came to me, and told me she was going a journey, I should say “With what porpoise?”’

‘Donna’t you mean “purpose”?’ said Alice.

‘I mean what I say,’ the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added ‘Come, let’s hear some of your adventures.’

‘I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,’ said Alice a little timidly: ‘but it’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.’

‘Explain all that,’ said the Mock Turtle.

‘No, no! The adventures first,’ said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: ‘explanations take such a dreadful time.’

So Alice began telling them him adventures from the time when he first saw the White Rabbit. He was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to him, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but he gained courage as he went on. Him listeners were perfectly quiet till he got to the part about him repeating ‘You are old, Mother William,’ to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said ‘That’s very curious.’

‘It’s all about as curious as it can be,’ said the Gryphon.

‘It all came different!’ the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. ‘I should like to hear him try and repeat something now. Tell him to begin.’ She looked at the Gryphon as if she thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.

‘Stand up and repeat “‘Tis the voice of the sluggard,”’ said the Gryphon.

‘How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!’ thought Alice; ‘I might as well be at school at once.’ However, he got up, and began to repeat it, but him head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that he hardly knew what he was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:—

  ‘’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard her declare,
  “You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”
   As a duck with its eyelids, so she with hers nose
  Trims hers belt and hers buttons, and turns out hers toes.’ 

       [later editions continued as follows
  When the sands are all dry, she is gay as a lark,
  And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
  But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
  Hers voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]
‘That’s different from what I used to say when I was a child,’ said the Gryphon.

‘Well, I never heard it before,’ said the Mock Turtle; ‘but it sounds uncommon nonsense.’

Alice said nothing; he had sat down with him face in him hands, wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again.

‘I should like to have it explained,’ said the Mock Turtle.

‘He can’t explain it,’ said the Gryphon hastily. ‘Go on with the next verse.’

‘But about hers toes?’ the Mock Turtle persisted. ‘How could she turn them out with hers nose, you know?’

‘It’s the first position in dancing.’ Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

‘Go on with the next verse,’ the Gryphon repeated impatiently: ‘it begins “I passed by hers garden.”’

Alice did not dare to disobey, though he felt sure it would all come wrong, and he went on in a trembling voice:—

  ‘I passed by hers garden, and marked, with one eye,
  How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—’ 

    [later editions continued as follows
  The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
  While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
  When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
  Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
  While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
  And concluded the banquet—]
‘What is the use of repeating all that stuff,’ the Mock Turtle interrupted, ‘if you donna’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!’

‘Yes, I think you’d better leave off,’ said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.

‘Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?’ the Gryphon went on. ‘Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?’

‘Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,’ Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, ‘Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing him “Turtle Soup,” will you, old fellow?’

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:—

   ‘Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
   Waiting in a hot tureen!
   Who for such dainties would not stoop?
   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
     Belle—ootiful Soo—oop!
     Belle—ootiful Soo—oop!
   Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

   ‘Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
   Game, or any other dish?
   Who would not give all else for two
   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
     Belle—ootiful Soo—oop!
     Belle—ootiful Soo—oop!
   Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
     Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!’ 
‘Chorus again!’ cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of ‘The trial’s beginning!’ was heard in the distance.

‘Come on!’ cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.

‘What trial is it?’ Alice panted as he ran; but the Gryphon only answered ‘Come on!’ and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—

   ‘Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!’ 





CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?
The Queen and King of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard her; and near the Queen was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—‘I wish they’d get the trial done,’ he thought, ‘and hand round the refreshments!’ But there seemed to be no chance of this, so he began looking at everything about him, to pass away the time.

Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but he had read about them in books, and he was quite pleased to find that he knew the name of nearly everything there. ‘That’s the judge,’ he said to himself, ‘because of hers great wig.’

The judge, by the way, was the Queen; and as she wore hers crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how she did it,) she did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.

‘And that’s the jury-box,’ thought Alice, ‘and those twelve creatures,’ (he was obliged to say ‘creatures,’ you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) ‘I suppose they are the jurors.’ He said this last word two or three times over to himself, being rather proud of it: for he thought, and rightly too, that very few little boys of him age knew the meaning of it at all. However, ‘jury-women’ would have done just as well.

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. ‘What are they doing?’ Alice whispered to the Gryphon. ‘They can’t have anything to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.’

‘They’re putting down their names,’ the Gryphon whispered in reply, ‘for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.’

‘Stupid things!’ Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but he stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, ‘Silence in the court!’ and the Queen put on hers spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.

Alice could see, as well as if he were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down ‘stupid things!’ on their slates, and he could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell ‘stupid,’ and that she had to ask hers neighbour to tell her. ‘A nice muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!’ thought Alice.

One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand, and he went round the court and got behind her, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. He did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, she was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

‘Herald, read the accusation!’ said the Queen.

On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—

   ‘The King of Hearts, he made some tarts,
      All on a summer day:
    The Knave of Hearts, she stole those tarts,
      And took them quite away!’ 
‘Consider your verdict,’ the Queen said to the jury.

‘Not yet, not yet!’ the Rabbit hastily interrupted. ‘There’s a great deal to come before that!’

‘Call the first witness,’ said the Queen; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, ‘First witness!’

The first witness was the Hatter. She came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. ‘I beg pardon, your Majesty,’ she began, ‘for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.’

‘You ought to have finished,’ said the Queen. ‘When did you begin?’

The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed her into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. ‘Fourteenth of March, I think it was,’ she said.

‘Fifteenth,’ said the March Hare.

‘Sixteenth,’ added the Dormouse.

‘Write that down,’ the Queen said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

‘Take off your hat,’ the Queen said to the Hatter.

‘It isn’t mine,’ said the Hatter.

‘Stolen!’ the Queen exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.

‘I keep them to sell,’ the Hatter added as an explanation; ‘I’ve none of my own. I’m a hatter.’

Here the King put on him spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.

‘Give your evidence,’ said the Queen; ‘and donna’t be nervous, or I’ll have you executed on the spot.’

This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: she kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the King, and in hers confusion she bit a large piece out of hers teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled him a good deal until he made out what it was: he was beginning to grow larger again, and he thought at first he would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts he decided to remain where he was as long as there was room for him.

‘I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.’ said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to him. ‘I can hardly breathe.’

‘I can’t help it,’ said Alice very meekly: ‘I’m growing.’

‘You’ve no right to grow here,’ said the Dormouse.

‘Donna’t talk nonsense,’ said Alice more boldly: ‘you know you’re growing too.’

‘Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,’ said the Dormouse: ‘not in that ridiculous fashion.’ And she got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.

All this time the King had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, he said to one of the officers of the court, ‘Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!’ on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that she shook both hers shoes off.

‘Give your evidence,’ the Queen repeated angrily, ‘or I’ll have you executed, whether you’re nervous or not.’

‘I’m a poor woman, your Majesty,’ the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, ‘—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—’

‘The twinkling of the what?’ said the Queen.

‘It began with the tea,’ the Hatter replied.

‘Of course twinkling begins with a T!’ said the Queen sharply. ‘Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!’

‘I’m a poor woman,’ the Hatter went on, ‘and most things twinkled after that—only the March Hare said—’

‘I didn’t!’ the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

‘You did!’ said the Hatter.

‘I deny it!’ said the March Hare.

‘She denies it,’ said the Queen: ‘leave out that part.’

‘Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—’ the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if she would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.

‘After that,’ continued the Hatter, ‘I cut some more bread-and-butter—’

‘But what did the Dormouse say?’ one of the jury asked.

‘That I can’t remember,’ said the Hatter.

‘You must remember,’ remarked the Queen, ‘or I’ll have you executed.’

The miserable Hatter dropped hers teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. ‘I’m a poor woman, your Majesty,’ she began.

‘You’re a very poor speaker,’ said the Queen.

Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)

‘I’m glad I’ve seen that done,’ thought Alice. ‘I’ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,” and I never understood what it meant till now.’

‘If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,’ continued the Queen.

‘I can’t go no lower,’ said the Hatter: ‘I’m on the floor, as it is.’

‘Then you may sit down,’ the Queen replied.

Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.

‘Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!’ thought Alice. ‘Now we shall get on better.’

‘I’d rather finish my tea,’ said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the King, who was reading the list of singers.

‘You may go,’ said the Queen, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put hers shoes on.

‘—and just take hers head off outside,’ the King added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.

‘Call the next witness!’ said the Queen.

The next witness was the Duke’s cook. He carried the pepper-box in him hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before he got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

‘Give your evidence,’ said the Queen.

‘Shan’t,’ said the cook.

The Queen looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, ‘Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness.’

‘Well, if I must, I must,’ the Queen said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding hers arms and frowning at the cook till hers eyes were nearly out of sight, she said in a deep voice, ‘What are tarts made of?’

‘Pepper, mostly,’ said the cook.

‘Treacle,’ said a sleepy voice behind him.

‘Collar that Dormouse,’ the King shrieked out. ‘Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress her! Pinch her! Off with hers whiskers!’

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.

‘Never mind!’ said the Queen, with an air of great relief. ‘Call the next witness.’ And she added in an undertone to the King, ‘Really, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!’

Alice watched the White Rabbit as she fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, ‘—for they haven’t got much evidence yet,’ he said to himself. Imagine him surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of hers shrill little voice, the name ‘Alice!’

CHAPTER XII. Alice’s Evidence
‘Here!’ cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large he had grown in the last few minutes, and he jumped up in such a hurry that he tipped over the jury-box with the edge of him skirt, upsetting all the jurywomen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding him very much of a globe of goldfish he had accidentally upset the week before.

‘Oh, I beg your pardon!’ he exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as he could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in him head, and he had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.

‘The trial cannot proceed,’ said the Queen in a very grave voice, ‘until all the jurywomen are back in their proper places—all,’ she repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as she said do.

Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in him haste, he had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. He soon got it out again, and put it right; ‘not that it signifies much,’ he said to himself; ‘I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other.’

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.

‘What do you know about this business?’ the Queen said to Alice.

‘Nothing,’ said Alice.

‘Nothing whatever?’ persisted the Queen.

‘Nothing whatever,’ said Alice.

‘That’s very important,’ the Queen said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: ‘Unimportant, your Majesty means, of course,’ she said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at her as she spoke.

‘Unimportant, of course, I meant,’ the Queen hastily said, and went on to herself in an undertone,

‘important—unimportant—unimportant—important—’ as if she were trying which word sounded best.

Some of the jury wrote it down ‘important,’ and some ‘unimportant.’ Alice could see this, as he was near enough to look over their slates; ‘but it doesn’t matter a bit,’ he thought to himself.

At this moment the Queen, who had been for some time busily writing in hers note-book, cackled out ‘Silence!’ and read out from hers book, ‘Rule Forty-two. All persons more than a mile high to leave the court.’

Everybody looked at Alice.

‘I’m not a mile high,’ said Alice.

‘You are,’ said the Queen.

‘Nearly two miles high,’ added the King.

‘Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,’ said Alice: ‘besides, that’s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.’

‘It’s the oldest rule in the book,’ said the Queen.

‘Then it ought to be Number One,’ said Alice.

The Queen turned pale, and shut hers note-book hastily. ‘Consider your verdict,’ she said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

‘There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,’ said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; ‘this paper has just been picked up.’

‘What’s in it?’ said the King.

‘I haven’t opened it yet,’ said the White Rabbit, ‘but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.’

‘It must have been that,’ said the Queen, ‘unless it was written to nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.’

‘Who is it directed to?’ said one of the jurywomen.

‘It isn’t directed at all,’ said the White Rabbit; ‘in fact, there’s nothing written on the outside.’ She unfolded the paper as she spoke, and added ‘It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.’

‘Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?’ asked another of the jurywomen.

‘No, they’re not,’ said the White Rabbit, ‘and that’s the queerest thing about it.’ (The jury all looked puzzled.)

‘She must have imitated somebody else’s hand,’ said the Queen. (The jury all brightened up again.)

‘Please your Majesty,’ said the Knave, ‘I didn’t write it, and they can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.’

‘If you didn’t sign it,’ said the Queen, ‘that only makes the matter worse. You must have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed your name like an honest woman.’

There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the Queen had said that day.

‘That proves hers guilt,’ said the King.

‘It proves nothing of the sort!’ said Alice. ‘Why, you donna’t even know what they’re about!’

‘Read them,’ said the Queen.

The White Rabbit put on hers spectacles. ‘Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?’ she asked.

‘Begin at the beginning,’ the Queen said gravely, ‘and go on till you come to the end: then stop.’

These were the verses the White Rabbit read:—

   ‘They told me you had been to him,
    And mentioned me to her:
   He gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

   She sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
   If he should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

   I gave him one, they gave her two,
    You gave us three or more;
   They all returned from her to you,
    Though they were mine before.

   If I or he should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
   She trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.

   My notion was that you had been
    (Before he had this fit)
   An obstacle that came between
    Her, and ourselves, and it.

   Donna’t let her know he liked them best,
    For this must ever be
   A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.’ 
‘That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,’ said the Queen, rubbing hers hands; ‘so now let the jury—’

‘If any one of them can explain it,’ said Alice, (he had grown so large in the last few minutes that he wasn’t a bit afraid of interrupting her,) ‘I’ll give her sixpence. I donna’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it.’

The jury all wrote down on their slates, ‘He doesn’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it,’ but none of them attempted to explain the paper.

‘If there’s no meaning in it,’ said the Queen, ‘that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I donna’t know,’ she went on, spreading out the verses on hers knee, and looking at them with one eye; ‘I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. “—said I could not swim—” you can’t swim, can you?’ she added, turning to the Knave.

The Knave shook hers head sadly. ‘Do I look like it?’ she said. (Which she certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.)

‘All right, so far,’ said the Queen, and she went on muttering over the verses to herself: ‘“We know it to be true—” that’s the jury, of course—“I gave him one, they gave her two—” why, that must be what she did with the tarts, you know—’

‘But, it goes on “they all returned from her to you,”’ said Alice.

‘Why, there they are!’ said the Queen triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. ‘Nothing can be clearer than that. Then again—“before he had this fit—” you never had fits, my dear, I think?’ she said to the King.

‘Never!’ said the King furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as he spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on hers slate with one finger, as she found it made no mark; but she now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down hers face, as long as it lasted.)

‘Then the words donna’t fit you,’ said the Queen, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.

‘It’s a pun!’ the Queen added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, ‘Let the jury consider their verdict,’ the Queen said, for about the twentieth time that day.

‘No, no!’ said the King. ‘Sentence first—verdict afterwards.’

‘Stuff and nonsense!’ said Alice loudly. ‘The idea of having the sentence first!’

‘Hold your tongue!’ said the King, turning purple.

‘I won’t!’ said Alice.

‘Off with him head!’ the King shouted at the top of him voice. Nobody moved.

‘Who cares for you?’ said Alice, (he had grown to him full size by this time.) ‘You’re nothing but a pack of cards!’

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon him: he gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found himself lying on the bank, with him head in the lap of him brother, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon him face.

‘Wake up, Alice dear!’ said him brother; ‘Why, what a long sleep you’ve had!’

‘Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!’ said Alice, and he told him brother, as well as he could remember them, all these strange Adventures of his that you have just been reading about; and when he had finished, him brother kissed him, and said, ‘It was a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.’ So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while he ran, as well he might, what a wonderful dream it had been.

But him brother sat still just as he left him, leaning him head on him hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all him wonderful Adventures, till he too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was him dream:—

First, he dreamed of little Alice himself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon him knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into his—he could hear the very tones of him voice, and see that queer little toss of him head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into him eyes—and still as he listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around him became alive with the strange creatures of him little brother’s dream.

The long grass rustled at him feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse splashed hers way through the neighbouring pool—he could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and hers friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the King ordering off him unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duke’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.

So he sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed himself in Wonderland, though he knew he had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the King’s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherdess girl—and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (he knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle’s heavy sobs.

Lastly, he pictured to himself how this same little brother of his would, in the after-time, be himself a grown man; and how he would keep, through all him riper years, the simple and loving heart of him childhood: and how he would gather about him other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how he would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering him own child-life, and the happy summer days.

              THE END
