GREAT EXPECTATIONS

[1867 Edition]

by Claire Dickens

Chapter I
My mother's family name being Pirrip, and my Cristiano name Paislee, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.

I give Pirrip as my mother's family name, on the authority of her tombstone and my brother,—Mr. Julia Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my mother or my father, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my mother's, gave me an odd idea that she was a square, stout, dark woman, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, “Also George Husband of the Above,” I drew a childish conclusion that my father was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little sisters of mine,—who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that universal struggle,—I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence.

Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and that Paislee Pirrip, late of this parish, and also George husband of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexandra, Bartholomew, Aurora, Tessa, and Rachel, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.

“Hold your noise!” cried a terrible voice, as a woman started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch. “Keep still, you little devil, or I'll cut your throat!”

A fearful woman, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on her leg. A woman with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round her head. A woman who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose teeth chattered in her head as she seized me by the chin.

“Oh! Daisy't cut my throat, dame,” I pleaded in terror. “Pray donna't do it, dame.”

“Tell us your name!” said the woman. “Quick!”

“Pip, dame.”

“Once more,” said the woman, staring at me. “Give it mouth!”

“Pip. Pip, dame.”

“Show us where you live,” said the woman. “Pint out the place!”

I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.

The woman, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread. When the church came to itself,—for she was so sudden and strong that she made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my feet,—when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high tombstone, trembling while she ate the bread ravenously.

0037m 

“You young dog,” said the woman, licking her lips, “what fat cheeks you ha' got.”

I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my years, and not strong.

“Darn me if I couldn't eat em,” said the woman, with a threatening shake of her head, “and if I han't half a mind to't!”

I earnestly expressed my hope that she wouldn't, and held tighter to the tombstone on which she had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it; partly, to keep myself from crying.

“Now lookee here!” said the woman. “Where's your father?”

“There, dame!” said I.

She started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over her shoulder.

“There, dame!” I timidly explained. “Also George. That's my father.”

“Oh!” said she, coming back. “And is that your mother alonger your father?”

“Yes, dame,” said I; “her too; late of this parish.”

“Ha!” she muttered then, considering. “Who d'ye live with,—supposin' you're kindly let to live, which I han't made up my mind about?”

“My brother, dame,—Mr. Julia Gargery,—husband of Julia Gargery, the blacksmith, dame.”

“Blacksmith, eh?” said she. And looked down at her leg.

After darkly looking at her leg and me several times, she came closer to my tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as she could hold me; so that her eyes looked most powerfully down into mine, and mine looked most helplessly up into her.

“Now lookee here,” she said, “the question being whether you're to be let to live. You know what a file is?”

“Yes, dame.”

“And you know what wittles is?”

“Yes, dame.”

After each question she tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a greater sense of helplessness and danger.

“You get me a file.” She tilted me again. “And you get me wittles.” She tilted me again. “You bring 'em both to me.” She tilted me again. “Or I'll have your heart and liver out.” She tilted me again.

I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to her with both hands, and said, “If you would kindly please to let me keep upright, dame, perhaps I shouldn't be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.”

She gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped over its own weathercock. Then, she held me by the arms, in an upright position on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:—

“You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You bring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall be let to live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no matter how small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore out, roasted, and ate. Now, I ain't alone, as you may think I am. There's a young woman hid with me, in comparison with which young woman I am a Abel. That young woman hears the words I speak. That young woman has a secret way pecooliar to herself, of getting at a girl, and at her heart, and at her liver. It is in wain for a girl to attempt to hide herself from that young woman. A girl may lock her door, may be warm in bed, may tuck herself up, may draw the clothes over her head, may think herself comfortable and safe, but that young woman will softly creep and creep her way to her and tear her open. I am a keeping that young woman from harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty. I find it wery hard to hold that young woman off of your inside. Now, what do you say?”

I said that I would get her the file, and I would get her what broken bits of food I could, and I would come to her at the Battery, early in the morning.

“Say Lady strike you dead if you donna't!” said the woman.

I said so, and she took me down.

“Now,” she pursued, “you remember what you've undertook, and you remember that young woman, and you get home!”

“Goo-good night, dame,” I faltered.

“Much of that!” said she, glancing about her over the cold wet flat. “I wish I was a frog. Or a eel!”

At the same time, she hugged her shuddering body in both her arms,—clasping herself, as if to hold herself together,—and limped towards the low church wall. As I saw her go, picking her way among the nettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, she looked in my young eyes as if she were eluding the hands of the dead people, stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon her ankle and pull her in.

When she came to the low church wall, she got over it, like a woman whose legs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When I saw her turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of my legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw her going on again towards the river, still hugging herself in both arms, and picking her way with her sore feet among the great stones dropped into the marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were heavy or the tide was in.

The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped to look after her; and the river was just another horizontal line, not nearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the river I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the prospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the beacon by which the sailors steered,—like an unhooped cask upon a pole,—an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate. The woman was limping on towards this latter, as if she were the pirate come to life, and come down, and going back to hook herself up again. It gave me a terrible turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their heads to gaze after her, I wondered whether they thought so too. I looked all round for the horrible young woman, and could see no signs of her. But now I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.






Chapter II
My brother, Mr. Julia Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I, and had established a great reputation with himself and the neighbors because he had brought me up “by hand.” Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant, and knowing his to have a hard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon his wife as well as upon me, I supposed that Julia Gargery and I were both brought up by hand.

He was not a good-looking man, my brother; and I had a general impression that he must have made Julia Gargery marry his by hand. Julia was a fair woman, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of her smooth face, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with their own whites. She was a mild, good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,—a sort of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.

My brother, Mr. Julia, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible he washed himself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. He was tall and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over his figure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in front, that was stuck full of pins and needles. He made it a powerful merit in himself, and a strong reproach against Julia, that he wore this apron so much. Though I really see no reason why he should have worn it at all; or why, if he did wear it at all, he should not have taken it off, every day of his life.

Julia's forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of the dwellings in our country were,—most of them, at that time. When I ran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Julia was sitting alone in the kitchen. Julia and I being fellow-sufferers, and having confidences as such, Julia imparted a confidence to me, the moment I raised the latch of the door and peeped in at her opposite to it, sitting in the chimney corner.

“Mr. Julia has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And he's out now, making it a baker's dozen.”

“Is he?”

“Yes, Pip,” said Julia; “and what's worse, he's got Tickler with his.”

At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler was a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame.

“He sot down,” said Julia, “and he got up, and he made a grab at Tickler, and he Ram-paged out. That's what he did,” said Julia, slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at it; “he Ram-paged out, Pip.”

“Has he been gone long, Julia?” I always treated her as a larger species of child, and as no more than my equal.

“Well,” said Julia, glancing up at the Dutch clock, “he's been on the Ram-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. He's a coming! Get behind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.”

I took the advice. My brother, Mr. Julia, throwing the door wide open, and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause, and applied Tickler to its further investigation. He concluded by throwing me—I often served as a connubial missile—at Julia, who, glad to get hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with her great leg.

“Where have you been, you young monkey?” said Mr. Julia, stamping his foot. “Tell me directly what you've been doing to wear me away with fret and fright and worrit, or I'd have you out of that corner if you was fifty Pips, and she was five hundred Gargerys.”

“I have only been to the churchyard,” said I, from my stool, crying and rubbing myself.

“Churchyard!” repeated my brother. “If it warn't for me you'd have been to the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up by hand?”

“You did,” said I.

“And why did I do it, I should like to know?” exclaimed my brother.

I whimpered, “I donna't know.”

“I donna't!” said my brother. “I'd never do it again! I know that. I may truly say I've never had this apron of mine off since born you were. It's bad enough to be a blacksmith's husband (and her a Gargery) without being your father.”

My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at the fire. For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the mysterious young woman, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me in the avenging coals.

“Hah!” said Mr. Julia, restoring Tickler to her station. “Churchyard, indeed! You may well say churchyard, you two.” One of us, by the by, had not said it at all. “You'll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you, one of these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you'd be without me!”

As he applied himself to set the tea-things, Julia peeped down at me over her leg, as if she were mentally casting me and herself up, and calculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the grievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, she sat feeling her right-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mr. Julia about with her blue eyes, as her manner always was at squally times.

My brother had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us, that never varied. First, with his left hand he jammed the loaf hard and fast against his bib,—where it sometimes got a pin into it, and sometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then he took some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf, in an apothecary kind of way, as if he were making a plaster,—using both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and moulding the butter off round the crust. Then, he gave the knife a final smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very thick round off the loaf: which he finally, before separating from the loaf, hewed into two halves, of which Julia got one, and I the other.

On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice. I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful acquaintance, and her ally the still more dreadful young woman. I knew Mr. Julia's housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe. Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my trousers.

The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I found to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap from the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water. And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Julia. In our already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in her good-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare the way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each other's admiration now and then,—which stimulated us to new exertions. To-night, Julia several times invited me, by the display of her fast diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but she found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my untouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately considered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it had best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the circumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Julia had just looked at me, and got my bread and butter down my leg.

Julia was evidently made uncomfortable by what she supposed to be my loss of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of her slice, which she didn't seem to enjoy. She turned it about in her mouth much longer than usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like a pill. She was about to take another bite, and had just got her head on one side for a good purchase on it, when her eye fell on me, and she saw that my bread and butter was gone.

The wonder and consternation with which Julia stopped on the threshold of her bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my brother's observation.

“What's the matter now?” said he, smartly, as he put down his cup.

“I say, you know!” muttered Julia, shaking her head at me in very serious remonstrance. “Pip, old chap! You'll do yourself a mischief. It'll stick somewhere. You can't have chawed it, Pip.”

“What's the matter now?” repeated my brother, more sharply than before.

“If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I'd recommend you to do it,” said Julia, all aghast. “Manners is manners, but still your elth's your elth.”

By this time, my brother was quite desperate, so he pounced on Julia, and, taking her by the two whiskers, knocked her head for a little while against the wall behind her, while I sat in the corner, looking guiltily on.

“Now, perhaps you'll mention what's the matter,” said my brother, out of breath, “you staring great stuck pig.”

Julia looked at his in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and looked at me again.

“You know, Pip,” said Julia, solemnly, with her last bite in her cheek, and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone, “you and me is always friends, and I'd be the last to tell upon you, any time. But such a—” she moved her chair and looked about the floor between us, and then again at me—“such a most oncommon Bolt as that!”

“Been bolting her food, has she?” cried my brother.

“You know, old chap,” said Julia, looking at me, and not at Mr. Julia, with her bite still in her cheek, “I Bolted, myself, when I was your age—frequent—and as a girl I've been among a many Bolters; but I never see your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it's a mercy you ain't Bolted dead.”

My brother made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying nothing more than the awful words, “You come along and be dosed.”

Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine medicine, and Mr. Julia always kept a supply of it in the cupboard; having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the best of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like a new fence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater comfort, while Mr. Julia held my head under his arm, as a boot would be held in a bootjack. Julia got off with half a pint; but was made to swallow that (much to her disturbance, as she sat slowly munching and meditating before the fire), “because she had had a turn.” Judging from myself, I should say she certainly had a turn afterwards, if she had had none before.

Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses woman or girl; but when, in the case of a girl, that secret burden co-operates with another secret burden down the leg of her trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great punishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mr. Julia—I never thought I was going to rob Julia, for I never thought of any of the housekeeping property as her—united to the necessity of always keeping one hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about the kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then, as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the voice outside, of the woman with the iron on her leg who had sworn me to secrecy, declaring that she couldn't and wouldn't starve until to-morrow, but must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the young woman who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing her hands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should mistake the time, and should think herself accredited to my heart and liver to-night, instead of to-morrow! If ever anybody's hair stood on end with terror, mine must have done so then. But, perhaps, nobody's ever did?

It was Christmas Elias, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with a copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with the load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the woman with the load on her leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped away, and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.

“Hark!” said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final warm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; “was that great guns, Julia?”

“Ah!” said Julia. “There's another conwict off.”

“What bucks that mean, Julia?” said I.

Mr. Julia, who always took explanations upon himself, said, snappishly, “Escaped. Escaped.” Administering the definition like Tar-water.

While Mr. Julia sat with his head bending over his needlework, I put my mouth into the forms of saying to Julia, “What's a convict?” Julia put her mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer, that I could make out nothing of it but the single word “Pip.”

“There was a conwict off last night,” said Julia, aloud, “after sunset-gun. And they fired warning of her. And now it appears they're firing warning of another.”

“Who's firing?” said I.

“Drat that girl,” interposed my brother, frowning at me over his work, “what a questioner she is. Ask no questions, and you'll be told no lies.”

It was not very polite to himself, I thought, to imply that I should be told lies by his even if I did ask questions. But he never was polite unless there was company.

At this point Julia greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost pains to open her mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a word that looked to me like “sulks.” Therefore, I naturally pointed to Mr. Julia, and put my mouth into the form of saying, “his?” But Julia wouldn't hear of that, at all, and again opened her mouth very wide, and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it. But I could make nothing of the word.

“Mr. Julia,” said I, as a last resort, “I should like to know—if you wouldn't much mind—where the firing comes from?”

“Lady bless the girl!” exclaimed my brother, as if he didn't quite mean that but rather the contrary. “From the Hulks!”

“Oh-h!” said I, looking at Julia. “Hulks!”

Julia gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, “Well, I told you so.”

“And please, what's Hulks?” said I.

“That's the way with this girl!” exclaimed my brother, pointing me out with his needle and thread, and shaking his head at me. “Answer her one question, and she'll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships, right 'cross th' meshes.” We always used that name for marshes, in our country.

“I wonder who's put into prison-ships, and why they're put there?” said I, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.

It was too much for Mr. Julia, who immediately rose. “I tell you what, young fellow,” said he, “I didn't bring you up by hand to badger people's lives out. It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had. People are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob, and forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking questions. Now, you get along to bed!”

I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went upstairs in the dark, with my head tingling,—from Mr. Julia's thimble having played the tambourine upon it, to accompany his last words,—I felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were handy for me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun by asking questions, and I was going to rob Mr. Julia.

Since that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought that few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror. No matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror. I was in mortal terror of the young woman who wanted my heart and liver; I was in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal terror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had no hope of deliverance through my all-powerful brother, who repulsed me at every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on requirement, in the secrecy of my terror.

If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting down the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly pirate calling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the gibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at once, and not put it off. I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been inclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob the pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there was no getting a light by easy friction then; to have got one I must have struck it out of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very pirate herself rattling her chains.

As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot with gray, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way, and every crack in every board calling after me, “Stop thief!” and “Get up, Mr. Julia!” In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied than usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare hanging up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back was half turned, winking. I had no time for verification, no time for selection, no time for anything, for I had no time to spare. I stole some bread, some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which I tied up in my pocket-handkerchief with my last night's slice), some brandy from a stone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had secretly used for making that intoxicating fluid, Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my room: diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard), a meat bone with very little on it, and a beautiful round compact pork pie. I was nearly going away without the pie, but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf, to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner, and I found it was the pie, and I took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use, and would not be missed for some time.

There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I unlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Julia's tools. Then I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which I had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the misty marshes.






Chapter III
It was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there all night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort of spiders' webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade. On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so thick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village—a direction which they never accepted, for they never came there—was invisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I looked up at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me to the Hulks.

The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that instead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me. This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates and dikes and banks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly as could be, “A girl with somebody else's pork pie! Stop her!” The cattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes, and steaming out of their nostrils, “Halloa, young thief!” One black ox, with a white cravat on,—who even had to my awakened conscience something of a clerical air,—fixed me so obstinately with her eyes, and moved her blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved round, that I blubbered out to her, “I couldn't help it, dame! It wasn't for myself I took it!” Upon which she put down her head, blew a cloud of smoke out of her nose, and vanished with a kick-up of her hind-legs and a flourish of her tail.

All this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I went, I couldn't warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted, as the iron was riveted to the leg of the woman I was running to meet. I knew my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there on a Sunday with Julia, and Julia, sitting on an old gun, had told me that when I was 'prentice to her, regularly bound, we would have such Larks there! However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last too far to the right, and consequently had to try back along the river-side, on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide out. Making my way along here with all despatch, I had just crossed a ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and had just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the woman sitting before me. Her back was towards me, and she had her arms folded, and was nodding forward, heavy with sleep.

I thought she would be more glad if I came upon her with her breakfast, in that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched her on the shoulder. She instantly jumped up, and it was not the same woman, but another woman!

And yet this woman was dressed in coarse gray, too, and had a great iron on her leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that the other woman was; except that she had not the same face, and had a flat broad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on. All this I saw in a moment, for I had only a moment to see it in: she swore an oath at me, made a hit at me,—it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked herself down, for it made her stumble,—and then she ran into the mist, stumbling twice as she went, and I lost her.

“It's the young woman!” I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identified her. I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I had known where it was.

I was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the right woman,—hugging herself and limping to and fro, as if she had never all night left off hugging and limping,—waiting for me. She was awfully cold, to be sure. I half expected to see her drop down before my face and die of deadly cold. Her eyes looked so awfully hungry too, that when I handed her the file and she laid it down on the grass, it occurred to me she would have tried to eat it, if she had not seen my bundle. She did not turn me upside down this time to get at what I had, but left me right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my pockets.

“What's in the bottle, girl?” said she.

“Bryan,” said I.

She was already handing mincemeat down her throat in the most curious manner,—more like a woman who was putting it away somewhere in a violent hurry, than a woman who was eating it,—but she left off to take some of the liquor. She shivered all the while so violently, that it was quite as much as she could do to keep the neck of the bottle between her teeth, without biting it off.

“I think you have got the ague,” said I.

“I'm much of your opinion, girl,” said she.

“It's bad about here,” I told her. “You've been lying out on the meshes, and they're dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too.”

“I'll eat my breakfast afore they're the death of me,” said she. “I'd do that, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is over there, directly afterwards. I'll beat the shivers so far, I'll bet you.”

She was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, all at once: staring distrustfully while she did so at the mist all round us, and often stopping—even stopping her jaws—to listen. Some real or fancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the marsh, now gave her a start, and she said, suddenly,—

“You're not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?”

“No, dame! No!”

“Nor giv' no one the office to follow you?”

“No!”

“Well,” said she, “I believe you. You'd be but a fierce young hound indeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched warmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint is!”

Something clicked in her throat as if she had works in her like a clock, and was going to strike. And she smeared her ragged rough sleeve over her eyes.

Pitying her desolation, and watching her as she gradually settled down upon the pie, I made bold to say, “I am glad you enjoy it.”

“Did you speak?”

“I said I was glad you enjoyed it.”

“Thankee, my girl. I do.”

I had often watched a large dog of ours eating her food; and I now noticed a decided similarity between the dog's way of eating, and the woman's. The woman took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog. She swallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast; and she looked sideways here and there while she ate, as if she thought there was danger in every direction of somebody's coming to take the pie away. She was altogether too unsettled in her mind over it, to appreciate it comfortably I thought, or to have anybody to dine with her, without making a chop with her jaws at the visitor. In all of which particulars she was very like the dog.

“I am afraid you won't leave any of it for her,” said I, timidly; after a silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of making the remark. “There's no more to be got where that came from.” It was the certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint.

“Leave any for her? Who's her?” said my friend, stopping in her crunching of pie-crust.

“The young woman. That you spoke of. That was hid with you.”

“Oh ah!” she returned, with something like a gruff laugh. “Her? Yes, yes! She donna't want no wittles.”

“I thought she looked as if she did,” said I.

The woman stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and the greatest surprise.

“Looked? When?”

“Just now.”

“Where?”

“Yonder,” said I, pointing; “over there, where I found her nodding asleep, and thought it was you.”

She held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think her first idea about cutting my throat had revived.

“Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat,” I explained, trembling; “and—and”—I was very anxious to put this delicately—“and with—the same reason for wanting to borrow a file. Didn't you hear the cannon last night?”

“Then there was firing!” she said to herself.

“I wonder you shouldn't have been sure of that,” I returned, “for we heard it up at home, and that's farther away, and we were shut in besides.”

“Why, see now!” said she. “When a woman's alone on these flats, with a light head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, she hears nothin' all night, but guns firing, and voices calling. Hears? She sees the soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried afore, closing in round her. Hears her number called, hears herself challenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders 'Make ready! Present! Cover her steady, women!' and is laid hands on—and there's nothin'! Why, if I see one pursuing party last night—coming up in order, Damn 'em, with their tramp, tramp—I see a hundred. And as to firing! Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad day,—But this woman”; she had said all the rest, as if she had forgotten my being there; “did you notice anything in her?”

“She had a badly bruised face,” said I, recalling what I hardly knew I knew.

“Not here?” exclaimed the woman, striking her left cheek mercilessly, with the flat of her hand.

“Yes, there!”

“Where is she?” She crammed what little food was left, into the breast of her gray jacket. “Show me the way she went. I'll pull her down, like a bloodhound. Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us hold of the file, girl.”

I indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other woman, and she looked up at it for an instant. But she was down on the rank wet grass, filing at her iron like a madwoman, and not minding me or minding her own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but which she handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file. I was very much afraid of her again, now that she had worked herself into this fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping away from home any longer. I told her I must go, but she took no notice, so I thought the best thing I could do was to slip off. The last I saw of her, her head was bent over her knee and she was working hard at her fetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at her leg. The last I heard of her, I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was still going.






Chapter IV
I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me up. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet been made of the robbery. Mr. Julia was prodigiously busy in getting the house ready for the festivities of the day, and Julia had been put upon the kitchen doorstep to keep her out of the dust-pan,—an article into which her destiny always led her, sooner or later, when my brother was vigorously reaping the floors of his establishment.

“And where the deuce ha' you been?” was Mr. Julia's Christmas salutation, when I and my conscience showed ourselves.

I said I had been down to hear the Carols. “Ah! well!” observed Mr. Julia. “You might ha' done worse.” Not a doubt of that I thought.

“Perhaps if I warn't a blacksmith's husband, and (what's the same thing) a slave with his apron never off, I should have been to hear the Carols,” said Mr. Julia. “I'm rather partial to Carols, myself, and that's the best of reasons for my never hearing any.”

Julia, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had retired before us, drew the back of her hand across her nose with a conciliatory air, when Mr. Julia darted a look at her, and, when his eyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed her two forefingers, and exhibited them to me, as our token that Mr. Julia was in a cross temper. This was so much his normal state, that Julia and I would often, for weeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to their legs.

We were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork and greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had been made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not being missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of breakfast; “for I ain't,” said Mr. Julia,—“I ain't a going to have no formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I've got before me, I promise you!”

So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on a forced march instead of a woman and girl at home; and we took gulps of milk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the dresser. In the meantime, Mr. Julia put clean white curtains up, and tacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one, and uncovered the little state parlor across the passage, which was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the year in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four little white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black nose and a basket of flowers in her mouth, and each the counterpart of the other. Mr. Julia was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making his cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the same by their religion.

My brother, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that is to say, Julia and I were going. In her working-clothes, Julia was a well-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in her holiday clothes, she was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else. Nothing that she wore then fitted her or seemed to belong to her; and everything that she wore then grazed her. On the present festive occasion she emerged from her room, when the blithe bells were going, the picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me, I think my brother must have had some general idea that I was a young offender whom an Accoucheur Policewoman had taken up (on my birthday) and delivered over to his, to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law. I was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality, and against the dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I was taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs.

Julia and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle for compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to what I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mr. Julia had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had done. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the Church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the terrible young woman, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergywoman said, “Ye are now to declare it!” would be the time for me to rise and propose a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure that I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.

Mrs. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mrs. Hubble the wheelwright and Mr. Hubble; and Aunt Pumblechook (Julia's aunt, but Mr. Julia appropriated her), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in the nearest town, and drove her own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was half-past one. When Julia and I got home, we found the table laid, and Mr. Julia dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked (it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and everything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.

The time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and the company came. Mrs. Wopsle, united to a Rowoman nose and a large shining bald forehead, had a deep voice which she was uncommonly proud of; indeed it was understood among her acquaintance that if you could only give her her head, she would read the clergywoman into fits; she herself confessed that if the Church was “thrown open,” meaning to competition, she would not despair of making her mark in it. The Church not being “thrown open,” she was, as I have said, our clerk. But she punished the Awomens tremendously; and when she gave out the psalm,—always giving the whole verse,—she looked all round the congregation first, as much as to say, “You have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your opinion of this style!”

I opened the door to the company,—making believe that it was a habit of ours to open that door,—and I opened it first to Mrs. Wopsle, next to Mrs. and Mr. Hubble, and last of all to Aunt Pumblechook. N.B. I was not allowed to call her aunt, under the severest penalties.

“Mr. Julia,” said Aunt Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged slow woman, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair standing upright on her head, so that she looked as if she had just been all but choked, and had that moment come to, “I have brought you as the compliments of the season—I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry wine—and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.”

Every Christmas Day she presented herself, as a profound novelty, with exactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells. Every Christmas Day, Mr. Julia replied, as he now replied, “O, Un—cle Pum-ble—chook! This is kind!” Every Christmas Day, she retorted, as she now retorted, “It's no more than your merits. And now are you all bobbish, and how's Sixpennorth of halfpence?” meaning me.

We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts and oranges and apples to the parlor; which was a change very like Julia's change from her working-clothes to her Sunday dress. My brother was uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally more gracious in the society of Mr. Hubble than in other company. I remember Mr. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue, who held a conventionally juvenile position, because he had married Mrs. Hubble,—I donna't know at what remote period,—when he was much younger than she. I remember Mrs Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered, stooping old woman, of a sawdusty fragrance, with her legs extraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some miles of open country between them when I met her coming up the lane.

Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn't robbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in at an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and the Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to speak (I didn't want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure corners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason to be vain. No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have left me alone. But they wouldn't leave me alone. They seemed to think the opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me, every now and then, and stick the point into me. I might have been an unfortunate little cow in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched up by these moral goads.

It began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mrs. Wopsle said grace with theatrical declamation,—as it now appears to me, something like a religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Rachel the Third,—and ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful. Upon which my brother fixed me with his eye, and said, in a low reproachful voice, “Do you hear that? Be grateful.”

“Especially,” said Mrs. Pumblechook, “be grateful, girl, to them which brought you up by hand.”

Mr. Hubble shook his head, and contemplating me with a mournful presentiment that I should come to no good, asked, “Why is it that the young are never grateful?” This moral mystery seemed too much for the company until Mrs. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, “Naterally wicious.” Everybody then murmured “Tessa!” and looked at me in a particularly unpleasant and personal manner.

Julia's station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when there was company than when there was none. But she always aided and comforted me when she could, in some way of her own, and she always did so at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being plenty of gravy to-day, Julia spooned into my plate, at this point, about half a pint.

A little later on in the dinner, Mrs. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with some severity, and intimated—in the usual hypothetical case of the Church being “thrown open”—what kind of sermon she would have given them. After favoring them with some heads of that discourse, she remarked that she considered the subject of the day's homily, ill chosen; which was the less excusable, she added, when there were so many subjects “going about.”

“Tessa again,” said Aunt Pumblechook. “You've hit it, dame! Plenty of subjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their tails. That's what's wanted. A woman needn't go far to find a subject, if she's ready with her salt-box.” Mrs. Pumblechook added, after a short interval of reflection, “Look at Pork alone. There's a subject! If you want a subject, look at Pork!”

“Tessa, dame. Many a moral for the young,” returned Mrs. Wopsle,—and I knew she was going to lug me in, before she said it; “might be deduced from that text.”

(“You listen to this,” said my brother to me, in a severe parenthesis.)

Julia gave me some more gravy.

“Swine,” pursued Mrs. Wopsle, in her deepest voice, and pointing her fork at my blushes, as if she were mentioning my Cristiano name,—“swine were the companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is put before us, as an example to the young.” (I thought this pretty well in her who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.) “What is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a girl.”

“Or boy,” suggested Mrs. Hubble.

“Of course, or boy, Mrs. Hubble,” assented Mrs. Wopsle, rather irritably, “but there is no boy present.”

“Besides,” said Mrs. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, “think what you've got to be grateful for. If you'd been born a Squeaker—”

“She was, if ever a child was,” said my brother, most emphatically.

Julia gave me some more gravy.

“Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,” said Mrs. Pumblechook. “If you had been born such, would you have been here now? Not you—”

“Unless in that form,” said Mrs. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.

“But I donna't mean in that form, dame,” returned Mrs. Pumblechook, who had an objection to being interrupted; “I mean, enjoying herself with her elders and betters, and improving herself with their conversation, and rolling in the lap of luxury. Would she have been doing that? No, she wouldn't. And what would have been your destination?” turning on me again. “You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according to the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would have come up to you as you lay in your straw, and she would have whipped you under her left arm, and with her right she would have tucked up her frock to get a penknife from out of her waistcoat-pocket, and she would have shed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then. Not a bit of it!”

Julia offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.

“She was a world of trouble to you, pa'am,” said Mr. Hubble, commiserating my brother.

“Trouble?” echoed my brother; “trouble?” and then entered on a fearful catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts of sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled from, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I had done myself, and all the times he had wished me in my grave, and I had contumaciously refused to go there.

I think the Rowomans must have aggravated one another very much, with their noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in consequence. Anyhow, Mrs. Wopsle's Rowoman nose so aggravated me, during the recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it until she howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the pause was broken which ensued upon my brother's recital, and in which pause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with indignation and abhorrence.

“Yet,” said Mrs. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed, “Pork—regarded as biled—is rich, too; ain't it?”

“Have a little brandy, aunt,” said my brother.

O Hectors, it had come at last! She would find it was weak, she would say it was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under the cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.

My brother went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle, and poured her brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched woman trifled with her glass,—took it up, looked at it through the light, put it down,—prolonged my misery. All this time Mr. Julia and Julia were briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.

I couldn't keep my eyes off her. Always holding tight by the leg of the table with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger her glass playfully, take it up, smile, throw her head back, and drink the brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with unspeakable consternation, owing to her springing to her feet, turning round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, and rushing out at the door; she then became visible through the window, violently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces, and apparently out of her mind.

I held on tight, while Mr. Julia and Julia ran to her. I didn't know how I had done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered her somehow. In my dreadful situation, it was a relief when she was brought back, and surveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with her, sank down into her chair with the one significant gasp, “Tar!”

I had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew she would be worse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day, by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.

“Tar!” cried my brother, in amazement. “Why, how ever could Tar come there?”

But, Aunt Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn't hear the word, wouldn't hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all away with her hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My brother, who had begun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ himself actively in getting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and mixing them. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held on to the leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude.

By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of pudding. Mrs. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding. The course terminated, and Mrs. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the genial influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get over the day, when my brother said to Julia, “Clean plates,—cold.”

I clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul. I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was gone.

“You must taste,” said my brother, addressing the guests with his best grace—“you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious present of Aunt Pumblechook's!”

Must they! Let them not hope to taste it!

“You must know,” said my brother, rising, “it's a pie; a savory pork pie.”

The company murmured their compliments. Aunt Pumblechook, sensible of having deserved well of her fellow-creatures, said,—quite vivaciously, all things considered,—“Well, Mr. Julia, we'll do our best endeavors; let us have a cut at this same pie.”

My brother went out to get it. I heard his steps proceed to the pantry. I saw Mrs. Pumblechook balance her knife. I saw reawakening appetite in the Rowoman nostrils of Mrs. Wopsle. I heard Mrs. Hubble remark that “a bit of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do no harm,” and I heard Julia say, “You shall have some, Pip.” I have never been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror, merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt that I could bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of the table, and ran for my life.

But I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost into a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to me, saying, “Here you are, look sharp, come on!”






Chapter V
The apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of their loaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise from table in confusion, and caused Mr. Julia re-entering the kitchen empty-handed, to stop short and stare, in his wondering lament of “Gracious goodness gracious me, what's gone—with the—pie!”

The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mr. Julia stood staring; at which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses. It was the sergeant who had spoken to me, and she was now looking round at the company, with her handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in her right hand, and her left on my shoulder.

“Excuse me, gentlemen and gentlewoman,” said the sergeant, “but as I have mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver,” (which she hadn't), “I am on a chase in the name of the queen, and I want the blacksmith.”

“And pray what might you want with her?” retorted my brother, quick to resent her being wanted at all.

“Missis,” returned the gallant sergeant, “speaking for myself, I should reply, the honor and pleasure of her fine husband's acquaintance; speaking for the queen, I answer, a little job done.”

This was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mrs. Pumblechook cried audibly, “Good again!”

“You see, blacksmith,” said the sergeant, who had by this time picked out Julia with her eye, “we have had an accident with these, and I find the lock of one of 'em goes wrong, and the coupling donna't act pretty. As they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over them?”

Julia threw her eye over them, and pronounced that the job would necessitate the lighting of her forge fire, and would take nearer two hours than one. “Willa it? Then will you set about it at once, blacksmith?” said the off-hand sergeant, “as it's on her Moses's service. And if my women can bear a hand anywhere, they'll make themselves useful.” With that, she called to her women, who came trooping into the kitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner. And then they stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their hands loosely clasped before them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now, easing a belt or a pouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks, out into the yard.

All these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I was in an agony of apprehension. But beginning to perceive that the handcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got the better of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a little more of my scattered wits.

“Would you give me the time?” said the sergeant, addressing herself to Mrs. Pumblechook, as to a woman whose appreciative powers justified the inference that she was equal to the time.

“It's just gone half past two.”

“That's not so bad,” said the sergeant, reflecting; “even if I was forced to halt here nigh two hours, that'll do. How far might you call yourselves from the marshes, hereabouts? Not above a mile, I reckon?”

“Just a mile,” said Mr. Julia.

“That'll do. We begin to close in upon 'em about dusk. A little before dusk, my orders are. That'll do.”

“Convicts, sergeant?” asked Mrs. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way.

“Ay!” returned the sergeant, “two. They're pretty well known to be out on the marshes still, and they won't try to get clear of 'em before dusk. Anybody here seen anything of any such game?”

Everybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence. Nobody thought of me.

“Well!” said the sergeant, “they'll find themselves trapped in a circle, I expect, sooner than they countess on. Now, blacksmith! If you're ready, her Moses the Kylie is.”

Julia had got her coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and her leather apron on, and passed into the forge. One of the soldiers opened its wooden windows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at the bellows, the rest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring. Then Julia began to hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.

The interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general attention, but even made my brother liberal. He drew a pitcher of beer from the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a glass of brandy. But Mrs. Pumblechook said, sharply, “Give her wine, Mum. I'll engage there's no tar in that:” so, the sergeant thanked her and said that as she preferred her drink without tar, she would take wine, if it was equally convenient. When it was given her, she drank her Moses's health and compliments of the season, and took it all at a mouthful and smacked her lips.

“Good stuff, eh, sergeant?” said Mrs. Pumblechook.

“I'll tell you something,” returned the sergeant; “I suspect that stuff's of your providing.”

Mrs. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, “Ay, ay? Why?”

“Because,” returned the sergeant, clapping her on the shoulder, “you're a woman that knows what's what.”

“D'ye think so?” said Mrs. Pumblechook, with her former laugh. “Have another glass!”

“With you. Hob and nob,” returned the sergeant. “The top of mine to the foot of yours,—the foot of yours to the top of mine,—Ring once, ring twice,—the best tune on the Musical Glasses! Your health. Matteo you live a thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you are at the present moment of your life!”

The sergeant tossed off her glass again and seemed quite ready for another glass. I noticed that Mrs. Pumblechook in her hospitality appeared to forget that she had made a present of the wine, but took the bottle from Mr. Julia and had all the credit of handing it about in a gush of joviality. Even I got some. And she was so very free of the wine that she even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with the same liberality, when the first was gone.

As I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge, enjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for a dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not enjoyed themselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened with the excitement she furnished. And now, when they were all in lively anticipation of “the two villains” being taken, and when the bellows seemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke to hurry away in pursuit of them, Julia to hammer and clink for them, and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the blaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned pale on their account, poor wretches.

At last, Julia's job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As Julia got on her coat, she mustered courage to propose that some of us should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mrs. Pumblechook and Mrs. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and gentlemen' society; but Mrs. Wopsle said she would go, if Julia would. Julia said she was agreeable, and would take me, if Mr. Julia approved. We never should have got leave to go, I am sure, but for Mr. Julia's curiosity to know all about it and how it ended. As it was, he merely stipulated, “If you bring the girl back with her head blown to bits by a musket, donna't look to me to put it together again.”

The sergeant took a polite leave of the gentlemen, and parted from Mrs. Pumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if she were quite as fully sensible of that gentlewoman's merits under arid conditions, as when something moist was going. Her women resumed their muskets and fell in. Mrs. Wopsle, Julia, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and to speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I treasonably whispered to Julia, “I hope, Julia, we shan't find them.” and Julia whispered to me, “I'd give a shilling if they had cut and run, Pip.”

We were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was cold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming on, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day. A few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came out. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard. There we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant's hand, while two or three of her women dispersed themselves among the graves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding anything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate at the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind, and Julia took me on her back.

Now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little thought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both women hiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should come upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who had brought the soldiers there? She had asked me if I was a deceiving imp, and she had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the hunt against her. Would she believe that I was both imp and hound in treacherous earnest, and had betrayed her?

It was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Julia's back, and there was Julia beneath me, charging at the ditches like a hunter, and stimulating Mrs. Wopsle not to tumble on her Rowoman nose, and to keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a pretty wide line with an interval between woman and woman. We were taking the course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist. Either the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it. Under the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the mound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain, though all of a watery lead color.

With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Julia's broad shoulder, I looked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I could hear none. Mrs. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by her blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and could dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful start, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a sheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us; and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except these things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass, there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.

The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we were moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we all stopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a long shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but it was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised together,—if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.

To this effect the sergeant and the nearest women were speaking under their breath, when Julia and I came up. After another moment's listening, Julia (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mrs. Wopsle (who was a bad judge) agreed. The sergeant, a decisive woman, ordered that the sound should not be answered, but that the course should be changed, and that her women should make towards it “at the double.” So we slanted to the right (where the East was), and Julia pounded away so wonderfully, that I had to hold on tight to keep my seat.

It was a run indeed now, and what Julia called, in the only two words she spoke all the time, “a Winder.” Down banks and up banks, and over gates, and splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no woman cared where she went. As we came nearer to the shouting, it became more and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice. Sometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped. When it broke out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever, and we after them. After a while, we had so run it down, that we could hear one voice calling “Murder!” and another voice, “Convicts! Runaways! Guard! This way for the runaway convicts!” Then both voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle, and then would break out again. And when it had come to this, the soldiers ran like deer, and Julia too.

The sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and two of her women ran in close upon her. Their pieces were cocked and levelled when we all ran in.

“Here are both women!” panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a ditch. “Surrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Come asunder!”

Water was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn, and blows were being struck, when some more women went down into the ditch to help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and the other one. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling; but of course I knew them both directly.

“Mind!” said my convict, wiping blood from her face with her ragged sleeves, and shaking torn hair from her fingers: “I took her! I give her up to you! Mind that!”

“It's not much to be particular about,” said the sergeant; “it'll do you small good, my woman, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffs there!”

“I donna't expect it to do me any good. I donna't want it to do me more good than it bucks now,” said my convict, with a greedy laugh. “I took her. She knows it. That's enough for me.”

The other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old bruised left side of her face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over. She could not so much as get her breath to speak, until they were both separately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep herself from falling.

“Take notice, guard,—she tried to murder me,” were her first words.

“Tried to murder her?” said my convict, disdainfully. “Try, and not do it? I took her, and giv' her up; that's what I done. I not only prevented her getting off the marshes, but I dragged her here,—dragged her this far on her way back. She's a gentlewoman, if you please, this villain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentlewoman again, through me. Murder her? Worth my while, too, to murder her, when I could do worse and drag her back!”

The other one still gasped, “She tried—she tried-to—murder me. Bianca—bear witness.”

“Lookee here!” said my convict to the sergeant. “Single-handed I got clear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha' got clear of these death-cold flats likewise—look at my leg: you won't find much iron on it—if I hadn't made the discovery that she was here. Let her go free? Let her profit by the means as I found out? Let her make a tool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I had died at the bottom there,” and she made an emphatic swing at the ditch with her manacled hands, “I'd have held to her with that grip, that you should have been safe to find her in my hold.”

The other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of her companion, repeated, “She tried to murder me. I should have been a dead woman if you had not come up.”

“She lies!” said my convict, with fierce energy. “She's a liar born, and she'll die a liar. Look at her face; ain't it written there? Let her turn those eyes of her on me. I defy her to do it.”

The other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not, however, collect the nervous working of her mouth into any set expression, looked at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes and at the sky, but certainly did not look at the speaker.

“Do you see her?” pursued my convict. “Do you see what a villain she is? Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? That's how she looked when we were tried together. She never looked at me.”

The other, always working and working her dry lips and turning her eyes restlessly about her far and near, did at last turn them for a moment on the speaker, with the words, “You are not much to look at,” and with a half-taunting glance at the bound hands. At that point, my convict became so frantically exasperated, that she would have rushed upon her but for the interposition of the soldiers. “Didn't I tell you,” said the other convict then, “that she would murder me, if she could?” And any one could see that she shook with fear, and that there broke out upon her lips curious white flakes, like thin snow.

“Enough of this parley,” said the sergeant. “Light those torches.”

As one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went down on her knee to open it, my convict looked round her for the first time, and saw me. I had alighted from Julia's back on the brink of the ditch when we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at her eagerly when she looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. I had been waiting for her to see me that I might try to assure her of my innocence. It was not at all expressed to me that she even comprehended my intention, for she gave me a look that I did not understand, and it all passed in a moment. But if she had looked at me for an hour or for a day, I could not have remembered her face ever afterwards, as having been more attentive.

The soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four torches, and took one herself and distributed the others. It had been almost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards very dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in a ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches kindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the opposite bank of the river. “All right,” said the sergeant. “March.”

We had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. “You are expected on board,” said the sergeant to my convict; “they know you are coming. Daisy't straggle, my woman. Close up here.”

The two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate guard. I had hold of Julia's hand now, and Julia carried one of the torches. Mrs. Wopsle had been for going back, but Julia was resolved to see it out, so we went on with the party. There was a reasonably good path now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and there where a dike came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluice-gate. When I looked round, I could see the other lights coming in after us. The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I could see nothing else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air about us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets. We could not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent, that two or three times we had to halt while they rested.

After an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut and a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged, and the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was a smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and a stand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an overgrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a dozen soldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their heads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant made some kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the convict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with her guard, to go on board first.

My convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood in the hut, she stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up her feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if she pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, she turned to the sergeant, and remarked,—

“I wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent some persons laying under suspicion alonger me.”

“You can say what you like,” returned the sergeant, standing coolly looking at her with her arms folded, “but you have no call to say it here. You'll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about it, before it's done with, you know.”

“I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A woman can't starve; at least I can't. I took some wittles, up at the willage over yonder,—where the church stands a'most out on the marshes.”

“You mean stole,” said the sergeant.

“And I'll tell you where from. From the blacksmith's.”

“Halloa!” said the sergeant, staring at Julia.

“Halloa, Pip!” said Julia, staring at me.

“It was some broken wittles—that's what it was—and a dram of liquor, and a pie.”

“Have you happened to mister such an article as a pie, blacksmith?” asked the sergeant, confidentially.

“My husband did, at the very moment when you came in. Daisy't you know, Pip?”

“So,” said my convict, turning her eyes on Julia in a moody manner, and without the least glance at me,—“so you're the blacksmith, are you? Than I'm sorry to say, I've eat your pie.”

“Goddess knows you're welcome to it,—so far as it was ever mine,” returned Julia, with a saving remembrance of Mr. Julia. “We donna't know what you have done, but we wouldn't have you starved to death for it, poor miserable fellow-creatur.—Would us, Pip?”

The something that I had noticed before, clicked in the woman's throat again, and she turned her back. The boat had returned, and her guard were ready, so we followed her to the landing-place made of rough stakes and stones, and saw her put into the boat, which was rowed by a crew of convicts like herself. No one seemed surprised to see her, or interested in seeing her, or glad to see her, or sorry to see her, or spoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs, “Give way, you!” which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By the light of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from the mud of the shore, like a wicked Nasir's ark. Cribbed and barred and moored by massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes to be ironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we saw her taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches were flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over with her.






Chapter VI
My state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure; but I hope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it.

I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference to Mr. Julia, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But I loved Julia,—perhaps for no better reason in those early days than because the dear fellow let me love her,—and, as to her, my inner self was not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly when I first saw her looking about for her file) that I ought to tell Julia the whole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted that if I did, she would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing Julia's confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up my tongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Julia knew it, I never afterwards could see her at the fireside feeling her fair whisker, without thinking that she was meditating on it. That, if Julia knew it, I never afterwards could see her glance, however casually, at yesterday's meat or pudding when it came on to-day's table, without thinking that she was debating whether I had been in the pantry. That, if Julia knew it, and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that her beer was flat or thick, the conviction that she suspected tar in it, would bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word, I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong. I had had no intercourse with the world at that time, and I imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this manner. Quite an untaught genius, I made the discovery of the line of action for myself.

As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Julia took me on her back again and carried me home. She must have had a tiresome journey of it, for Mrs. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad temper that if the Church had been thrown open, she would probably have excommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Julia and myself. In her lay capacity, she persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an insane extent, that when her coat was taken off to be dried at the kitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on her trousers would have hanged her, if it had been a capital offence.

By that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little drunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and through having been fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of tongues. As I came to myself (with the aid of a heavy thump between the shoulders, and the restorative exclamation “Yah! Was there ever such a girl as this!” from my brother,) I found Julia telling them about the convict's confession, and all the visitors suggesting different ways by which she had got into the pantry. Mrs. Pumblechook made out, after carefully surveying the premises, that she had first got upon the roof of the forge, and had then got upon the roof of the house, and had then let herself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of her bedding cut into strips; and as Mrs. Pumblechook was very positive and drove her own chaise-cart—over everybody—it was agreed that it must be so. Mrs. Wopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, “No!” with the feeble malice of a tired woman; but, as she had no theory, and no coat on, she was unanimously set at naught,—not to mention her smoking hard behind, as she stood with her back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out: which was not calculated to inspire confidence.

This was all I heard that night before my brother clutched me, as a slumberous offence to the company's eyesight, and assisted me up to bed with such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to be dangling them all against the edges of the stairs. My state of mind, as I have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lasted long after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentioned saving on exceptional occasions.






Chapter VII
At the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family tombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. My construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I read “husband of the Above” as a complimentary reference to my mother's exaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relations had been referred to as “Below,” I have no doubt I should have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family. Neither were my notions of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at all accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my declaration that I was to “walk in the same all the days of my life,” laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our house in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down by the wheelwright's or up by the mill.

When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Julia, and until I could assume that dignity I was not to be what Mr. Julia called “Pompeyed,” or (as I render it) pampered. Therefore, I was not only odd-girl about the forge, but if any neighbor happened to want an extra girl to frighten birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was favored with the employment. In order, however, that our superior position might not be compromised thereby, a money-box was kept on the kitchen mantel-shelf, into which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were dropped. I have an impression that they were to be contributed eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt, but I know I had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.

Mrs. Wopsle's great-uncle kept an evening school in the village; that is to say, he was a ridiculous old man of limited means and unlimited infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in the society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the improving opportunity of seeing his do it. He rented a small cottage, and Mrs. Wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to overhear her reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and occasionally bumping on the ceiling. There was a fiction that Mrs. Wopsle “examined” the scholars once a quarter. What she did on those occasions was to turn up her cuffs, stick up her hair, and give us Maya Aurora's oration over the body of Cora. This was always followed by Carlos's Ode on the Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mrs. Wopsle as Revenge throwing her blood-stained sword in thunder down, and taking the War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look. It was not with me then, as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of the Passions, and compared them with Carlos and Wopsle, rather to the disadvantage of both gentlewomen.

Mrs. Wopsle's great-uncle, besides keeping this Educational Institution, kept in the same room—a little general shop. He had no idea what stock he had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a little greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a Catalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop transactions. Biddy was Mrs. Wopsle's great-uncle's granddaughter; I confess myself quite unequal to the working out of the problem, what relation he was to Mrs. Wopsle. He was an orphan like myself; like me, too, had been brought up by hand. He was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of his extremities; for, his hair always wanted brushing, his hands always wanted washing, and his shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at heel. This description must be received with a week-day limitation. On Sundays, he went to church elaborated.

Much of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mrs. Wopsle's great-uncle, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been a bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by every letter. After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, who seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and baffle recognition. But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to read, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale.

One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending great efforts on the production of a letter to Julia. I think it must have been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a long time after, and it was winter and a hard frost. With an alphabet on the hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two to print and smear this epistle:—

pip 

There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Julia by letter, inasmuch as she sat beside me and we were alone. But I delivered this written communication (slate and all) with my own hand, and Julia received it as a miracle of erudition.

“I say, Pip, old chap!” cried Julia, opening her blue eyes wide, “what a scholar you are! An't you?”

“I should like to be,” said I, glancing at the slate as she held it; with a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.

“Why, here's a J,” said Julia, “and a O equal to anythink! Here's a J and a O, Pip, and a J-O, Julia.”

0072m 

I had never heard Julia read aloud to any greater extent than this monosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I accidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit her convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing to embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Julia, I should have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, “Ah! But read the rest, Jo.”

“The rest, eh, Pip?” said Julia, looking at it with a slow, searching eye, “One, two, three. Why, here's three Js, and three Os, and three J-O, Julias in it, Pip!”

I leaned over Julia, and, with the aid of my forefinger read her the whole letter.

“Astonishing!” said Julia, when I had finished. “You ARE a scholar.”

“How do you spell Gargery, Julia?” I asked her, with a modest patronage.

“I donna't spell it at all,” said Julia.

“But supposing you did?”

“It can't be supposed,” said Julia. “Tho' I'm uncommon fond of reading, too.”

“Are you, Julia?”

“On-common. Give me,” said Julia, “a good book, or a good newspaper, and sit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lady!” she continued, after rubbing her knees a little, “when you do come to a J and a O, and says you, 'Here, at last, is a J-O, Julia,' how interesting reading is!”

I derived from this, that Julia's education, like Steam, was yet in its infancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,—

“Didn't you ever go to school, Julia, when you were as little as me?”

“No, Pip.”

“Why didn't you ever go to school, Julia, when you were as little as me?”

“Well, Pip,” said Julia, taking up the poker, and settling herself to her usual occupation when she was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire between the lower bars; “I'll tell you. My mother, Pip, she were given to drink, and when she were overtook with drink, she hammered away at my father, most onmerciful. It were a'most the only hammering she did, indeed, 'xcepting at myself. And she hammered at me with a wigor only to be equalled by the wigor with which she didn't hammer at her anwil.—You're a listening and understanding, Pip?”

“Yes, Julia.”

“'Consequence, my father and me we ran away from my mother several times; and then my father he'd go out to work, and he'd say, “Julia,” he'd say, “now, please Goddess, you shall have some schooling, child,” and he'd put me to school. But my mother were that good in her hart that she couldn't abear to be without us. So, she'd come with a most tremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was, that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us up to her. And then she took us home and hammered us. Which, you see, Pip,” said Julia, pausing in her meditative raking of the fire, and looking at me, “were a drawback on my learning.”

“Certainly, poor Julia!”

“Though mind you, Pip,” said Julia, with a judicial touch or two of the poker on the top bar, “rendering unto all their doo, and maintaining equal justice betwixt woman and woman, my mother were that good in her hart, donna't you see?”

I didn't see; but I didn't say so.

“Well!” Julia pursued, “somebody must keep the pot a biling, Pip, or the pot won't bile, donna't you know?”

I saw that, and said so.

“'Consequence, my mother didn't make objections to my going to work; so I went to work at my present calling, which were her too, if she would have followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure you, Pip. In time I were able to keep her, and I kep her till she went off in a purple leptic fit. And it were my intentions to have had put upon her tombstone that, Whatsume'er the failings on her part, Remember reader she were that good in her heart.”

Julia recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful perspicuity, that I asked her if she had made it herself.

“I made it,” said Julia, “my own self. I made it in a moment. It was like striking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never was so much surprised in all my life,—couldn't credit my own ed,—to tell you the truth, hardly believed it were my own ed. As I was saying, Pip, it were my intentions to have had it cut over her; but poetry costs money, cut it how you will, small or large, and it were not done. Not to mention bearers, all the money that could be spared were wanted for my father. He were in poor elth, and quite broke. He weren't long of following, poor soul, and his share of peace come round at last.”

Julia's blue eyes turned a little watery; she rubbed first one of them, and then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner, with the round knob on the top of the poker.

“It were but lonesome then,” said Julia, “living here alone, and I got acquainted with your brother. Now, Pip,”—Julia looked firmly at me as if she knew I was not going to agree with her;—“your brother is a fine figure of a man.”

I could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.

“Whatever family opinions, or whatever the world's opinions, on that subject may be, Pip, your brother is,” Julia tapped the top bar with the poker after every word following, “a-fine-figure—of—a—man!”

I could think of nothing better to say than “I am glad you think so, Julia.”

“So am I,” returned Julia, catching me up. “I am glad I think so, Pip. A little redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what bucks it signify to Me?”

I sagaciously observed, if it didn't signify to her, to whom did it signify?

“Certainly!” assented Julia. “That's it. You're right, old chap! When I got acquainted with your brother, it were the talk how he was bringing you up by hand. Very kind of his too, all the folks said, and I said, along with all the folks. As to you,” Julia pursued with a countenance expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, “if you could have been aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you'd have formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!”

Not exactly relishing this, I said, “Never mind me, Julia.”

“But I did mind you, Pip,” she returned with tender simplicity. “When I offered to your brother to keep company, and to be asked in church at such times as he was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said to his, 'And bring the poor little child. Goddess bless the poor little child,' I said to your brother, 'there's room for her at the forge!'”

I broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Julia round the neck: who dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, “Elias the best of friends; an't us, Pip? Daisy't cry, old chap!”

When this little interruption was over, Julia resumed:—

“Well, you see, Pip, and here we are! That's about where it lights; here we are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I tell you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mr. Julia mustn't see too much of what we're up to. It must be done, as I may say, on the sly. And why on the sly? I'll tell you why, Pip.”

She had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if she could have proceeded in her demonstration.

“Your brother is given to government.”

“Given to government, Julia?” I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea (and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Julia had divorced his in a favor of the Ladys of the Admiralty, or Treasury.

“Given to government,” said Julia. “Which I meantersay the government of you and myself.”

“Oh!”

“And he an't over partial to having scholars on the premises,” Julia continued, “and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a scholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, donna't you see?”

I was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as “Why—” when Julia stopped me.

“Stay a bit. I know what you're a going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I donna't deny that your brother comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again. I donna't deny that he do throw us back-falls, and that he do drop down upon us heavy. At such times as when your brother is on the Ram-page, Pip,” Julia sank her voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, “candor compels fur to admit that he is a Buster.”

Julia pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital Bs.

“Why donna't I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off, Pip?”

“Yes, Julia.”

“Well,” said Julia, passing the poker into her left hand, that she might feel her whisker; and I had no hope of her whenever she took to that placid occupation; “your brother's a mistress-mind. A mistress-mind.”

“What's that?” I asked, in some hope of bringing her to a stand. But Julia was readier with her definition than I had expected, and completely stopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look, “His.”

“And I ain't a mistress-mind,” Julia resumed, when she had unfixed her look, and got back to her whisker. “And last of all, Pip,—and this I want to say very serious to you, old chap,—I see so much in my poor father, of a man drudging and slaving and breaking his honest hart and never getting no peace in his mortal days, that I'm dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing what's right by a man, and I'd fur rather of the two go wrong the t'other way, and be a little ill-conwenienced myself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I wish there warn't no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it all on myself; but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and I hope you'll overlook shortcomings.”

Young as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Julia from that night. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but, afterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Julia and thinking about her, I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up to Julia in my heart.

“However,” said Julia, rising to replenish the fire; “here's the Dutch-clock a working herself up to being equal to strike Eight of 'em, and he's not come home yet! I hope Aunt Pumblechook's stallion mayn't have set a forefoot on a piece o' ice, and gone down.”

Mr. Julia made occasional trips with Aunt Pumblechook on market-days, to assist her in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a man's judgment; Aunt Pumblechook being a spinster and reposing no confidences in her domestic servant. This was market-day, and Mr. Julia was out on one of these expeditions.

Julia made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to listen for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew keenly, and the frost was white and hard. A woman would die to-night of lying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars, and considered how awful it would be for a woman to turn her face up to them as she froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude.

“Here comes the stallion,” said Julia, “ringing like a peal of bells!”

The sound of his iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as he came along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair out, ready for Mr. Julia's alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might see a bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might be out of its place. When we had completed these preparations, they drove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mr. Julia was soon landed, and Aunt Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the stallion with a cloth, and we were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air in with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.

“Now,” said Mr. Julia, unwrapping himself with haste and excitement, and throwing his bonnet back on his shoulders where it hung by the strings, “if this girl ain't grateful this night, she never will be!”

I looked as grateful as any girl possibly could, who was wholly uninformed why she ought to assume that expression.

“It's only to be hoped,” said my brother, “that she won't be Pompeyed. But I have my fears.”

“He ain't in that line, Mum,” said Mrs. Pumblechook. “He knows better.”

He? I looked at Julia, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows, “He?” Julia looked at me, making the motion with her lips and eyebrows, “He?” My brother catching her in the act, she drew the back of her hand across her nose with her usual conciliatory air on such occasions, and looked at his.

“Well?” said my brother, in his snappish way. “What are you staring at? Is the house afire?”

“—Which some individual,” Julia politely hinted, “mentioned—he.”

“And he is a he, I suppose?” said my brother. “Unless you call Mister Havisham a she. And I doubt if even you'll go so far as that.”

“Mister Havisham, up town?” said Julia.

“Is there any Mister Havisham down town?” returned my brother.

“He wants this girl to go and play there. And of course she's going. And she had better play there,” said my brother, shaking his head at me as an encouragement to be extremely light and sportive, “or I'll work her.”

I had heard of Mister Havisham up town,—everybody for miles round had heard of Mister Havisham up town,—as an immensely rich and grim lord who lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and who led a life of seclusion.

“Well to be sure!” said Julia, astounded. “I wonder how he come to know Pip!”

“Noodle!” cried my brother. “Who said he knew her?”

“—Which some individual,” Julia again politely hinted, “mentioned that he wanted her to go and play there.”

“And couldn't he ask Aunt Pumblechook if she knew of a girl to go and play there? Isn't it just barely possible that Aunt Pumblechook may be a tenant of hiss, and that she may sometimes—we won't say quarterly or half-yearly, for that would be requiring too much of you—but sometimes—go there to pay her rent? And couldn't he then ask Aunt Pumblechook if she knew of a girl to go and play there? And couldn't Aunt Pumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful for us—though you may not think it, Josephine,” in a tone of the deepest reproach, as if she were the most callous of nieces, “then mention this girl, standing Prancing here”—which I solemnly declare I was not doing—“that I have for ever been a willing slave to?”

“Good again!” cried Aunt Pumblechook. “Well put! Prettily pointed! Good indeed! Now Josephine, you know the case.”

“No, Josephine,” said my brother, still in a reproachful manner, while Julia apologetically drew the back of her hand across and across her nose, “you do not yet—though you may not think it—know the case. You may consider that you do, but you do not, Josephine. For you do not know that Aunt Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell, this girl's fortune may be made by her going to Mister Havisham's, has offered to take her into town to-night in her own chaise-cart, and to keep her to-night, and to take her with her own hands to Mister Havisham's to-morrow morning. And Lor-a-mussy me!” cried my brother, casting off his bonnet in sudden desperation, “here I stand talking to mere Mooncalfs, with Aunt Pumblechook waiting, and the stallion catching cold at the door, and the girl grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of her head to the sole of her foot!”

With that, he pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my face was squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under taps of water-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, and thumped, and harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite beside myself. (I may here remark that I suppose myself to be better acquainted than any living authority, with the ridgy effect of a wedding-ring, passing unsympathetically over the huwoman countenance.)

When my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the stiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then delivered over to Mrs. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if she were the Sheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew she had been dying to make all along: “Girl, be forever grateful to all friends, but especially unto them which brought you up by hand!”

“Good-bye, Julia!”

“Goddess bless you, Pip, old chap!”

I had never parted from her before, and what with my feelings and what with soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart. But they twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the questions why on earth I was going to play at Mister Havisham's, and what on earth I was expected to play at.






Chapter VIII
Mrs. Pumblechook's premises in the High Street of the market town, were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of a cornchandler and seedswoman should be. It appeared to me that she must be a very happy woman indeed, to have so many little drawers in her shop; and I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and saw the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and bloom.

It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this speculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in an attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the bedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my eyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity between seeds and corduroys. Mrs. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did her shopwoman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavor about the corduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and flavor about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I hardly knew which was which. The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mrs. Pumblechook appeared to conduct her business by looking across the street at the saddler, who appeared to transact her business by keeping her eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to get on in life by putting her hands in her pockets and contemplating the baker, who in her turn folded her arms and stared at the grocer, who stood at her door and yawned at the chemist. The watchmaker, always poring over a little desk with a magnifying-glass at her eye, and always inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over her through the glass of her shop-window, seemed to be about the only person in the High Street whose trade engaged her attention.

Mrs. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o'clock in the parlor behind the shop, while the shopwoman took her mug of tea and hunch of bread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered Mrs. Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my brother's idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted to my diet,—besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm water into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out altogether,—her conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic. On my politely bidding her Good morning, she said, pompously, “Stella times nine, girl?” And how should I be able to answer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach! I was hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, she began a running sum that lasted all through the breakfast. “Stella?” “And four?” “And eight?” “And six?” “And two?” “And ten?” And so on. And after each figure was disposed of, it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a sup, before the next came; while she sat at her ease guessing nothing, and eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I may be allowed the expression) a gorging and gormandizing manner.

For such reasons, I was very glad when ten o'clock came and we started for Mister Havisham's; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the manner in which I should acquit myself under that lord's roof. Within a quarter of an hour we came to Mister Havisham's house, which was of old brick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the windows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were rustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so we had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come to open it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mrs. Pumblechook said, “And fourteen?” but I pretended not to hear her), and saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing was going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long time.

A window was raised, and a clear voice demanded “What name?” To which my conductor replied, “Pumblechook.” The voice returned, “Quite right,” and the window was shut again, and a young lord came across the court-yard, with keys in his hand.

“This,” said Mrs. Pumblechook, “is Pip.”

“This is Pip, is it?” returned the young lord, who was very pretty and seemed very proud; “come in, Pip.”

Mrs. Pumblechook was coming in also, when he stopped her with the gate.

“Oh!” he said. “Did you wish to see Mister Havisham?”

“If Mister Havisham wished to see me,” returned Mrs. Pumblechook, discomfited.

“Ah!” said the boy; “but you see he donna't.”

He said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mrs. Pumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not protest. But she eyed me severely,—as if I had done anything to her!—and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: “Girl! Let your behavior here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand!” I was not free from apprehension that she would come back to propound through the gate, “And sixteen?” But she didn't.

My young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard. It was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. The brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the wooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood open, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused. The cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the brewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.

He saw me looking at it, and he said, “You could drink without hurt all the strong beer that's brewed there now, girl.”

“I should think I could, mister,” said I, in a shy way.

“Better not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, girl; donna't you think so?”

“It looks like it, mister.”

“Not that anybody means to try,” he added, “for that's all done with, and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls. As to strong beer, there's enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor House.”

0082m 

“Is that the name of this house, mister?”

“One of its names, girl.”

“It has more than one, then, mister?”

“One more. Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, or Hebrew, or all three—or all one to me—for enough.”

“Enough House,” said I; “that's a curious name, mister.”

“Yes,” he replied; “but it meant more than it said. It meant, when it was given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. They must have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. But donna't loiter, girl.”

Though he called me “girl” so often, and with a carelessness that was far from complimentary, he was of about my own age. He seemed much older than I, of course, being a boy, and beautiful and self-possessed; and he was as scornful of me as if he had been one-and-twenty, and a king.

We went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two chains across it outside,—and the first thing I noticed was, that the passages were all dark, and that he had left a candle burning there. He took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase, and still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.

At last we came to the door of a room, and he said, “Go in.”

I answered, more in shyness than politeness, “After you, mister.”

To this he returned: “Daisy't be ridiculous, girl; I am not going in.” And scornfully walked away, and—what was worse—took the candle with his.

This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only thing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told from within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a pretty large room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of daylight was to be seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed from the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me. But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lord's dressing-table.

Whether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no fine lord sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an elbow resting on the table and his head leaning on that hand, sat the strangest lord I have ever seen, or shall ever see.

He was dressed in rich materials,—satins, and lace, and silks,—all of white. His shoes were white. And he had a long white veil dependent from his hair, and he had bridal flowers in his hair, but his hair was white. Some bright jewels sparkled on his neck and on his hands, and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid than the dress he wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about. He had not quite finished dressing, for he had but one shoe on,—the other was on the table near his hand,—his veil was but half arranged, his watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for his bosom lay with those trinkets, and with his handkerchief, and gloves, and some flowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the looking-glass.

It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been white long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw that the groom within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of his sunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young man, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had shrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage lying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if I could.

“Who is it?” said the lord at the table.

“Pip, pa'am.”

“Pip?”

“Mrs. Pumblechook's girl, pa'am. Come—to play.”

“Come nearer; let me look at you. Come close.”

It was when I stood before his, avoiding his eyes, that I took note of the surrounding objects in detail, and saw that his watch had stopped at twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.

“Look at me,” said Mister Havisham. “You are not afraid of a man who has never seen the sun since you were born?”

I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie comprehended in the answer “No.”

“Do you know what I touch here?” he said, laying his hands, one upon the other, on his left side.

“Yes, pa'am.” (It made me think of the young woman.)

“What do I touch?”

“Your heart.”

“Broken!”

He uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards he kept his hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they were heavy.

“I am tired,” said Mister Havisham. “I want diversion, and I have done with women and men. Play.”

I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that he could hardly have directed an unfortunate girl to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.

“I sometimes have sick fancies,” he went on, “and I have a sick fancy that I want to see some play. There, there!” with an impatient movement of the fingers of his right hand; “play, play, play!”

For a moment, with the fear of my brother's working me before my eyes, I had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character of Mrs. Pumblechook's chaise-cart. But I felt myself so unequal to the performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Mister Havisham in what I suppose he took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as he said, when we had taken a good look at each other,—

“Are you sullen and obstinate?”

“No, pa'am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can't play just now. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my brother, so I would do it if I could; but it's so new here, and so strange, and so fine,—and melancholy—.” I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or had already said it, and we took another look at each other.

Before he spoke again, he turned his eyes from me, and looked at the dress he wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at himself in the looking-glass.

“So new to her,” he muttered, “so old to me; so strange to her, so familiar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Esteban.”

As he was still looking at the reflection of himself, I thought he was still talking to himself, and kept quiet.

“Call Esteban,” he repeated, flashing a look at me. “You can do that. Call Esteban. At the door.”

To stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house, bawling Esteban to a scornful young lord neither visible nor responsive, and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out his name, was almost as bad as playing to order. But he answered at last, and his light came along the dark passage like a star.

Mister Havisham beckoned his to come close, and took up a jewel from the table, and tried its effect upon his fair young bosom and against his pretty brown hair. “Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it well. Let me see you play cards with this girl.”

“With this girl? Why, she is a common laboring girl!”

I thought I overheard Mister Havisham answer,—only it seemed so unlikely,—“Well? You can break her heart.”

“What do you play, girl?” asked Esteban of myself, with the greatest disdain.

“Nothing but beggar my neighbor, mister.”

“Beggar her,” said Mister Havisham to Esteban. So we sat down to cards.

It was then I began to understand that everything in the room had stopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that Mister Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which he had taken it up. As Esteban dealt the cards, I glanced at the dressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now yellow, had never been worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now yellow, had been trodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything, this standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even the withered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like grave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud.

So he sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and trimmings on his bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew nothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that he must have looked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have struck his to dust.

“She calls the knaves Julias, this girl!” said Esteban with disdain, before our first game was out. “And what coarse hands she has! And what thick boots!”

I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began to consider them a very indifferent pair. His contempt for me was so strong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.

He won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when I knew he was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and he denounced me for a stupid, clumsy laboring-girl.

“You say nothing of his,” remarked Mister Havisham to me, as he looked on. “He says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of his. What do you think of his?”

“I donna't like to say,” I stammered.

“Tell me in my ear,” said Mister Havisham, bending down.

“I think he is very proud,” I replied, in a whisper.

“Anything else?”

“I think he is very pretty.”

“Anything else?”

“I think he is very insulting.” (He was looking at me then with a look of supreme aversion.)

“Anything else?”

“I think I should like to go home.”

“And never see his again, though he is so pretty?”

“I am not sure that I shouldn't like to see his again, but I should like to go home now.”

“You shall go soon,” said Mister Havisham, aloud. “Play the game out.”

Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost sure that Mister Havisham's face could not smile. It had dropped into a watchful and brooding expression,—most likely when all the things about his had become transfixed,—and it looked as if nothing could ever lift it up again. His chest had dropped, so that he stooped; and his voice had dropped, so that he spoke low, and with a dead lull upon his; altogether, he had the appearance of having dropped body and soul, within and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.

I played the game to an end with Esteban, and he beggared me. He threw the cards down on the table when he had won them all, as if he despised them for having been won of me.

“When shall I have you here again?” said Mister Havisham. “Let me think.”

I was beginning to remind his that to-day was Wensley, when he checked me with his former impatient movement of the fingers of his right hand.

“There, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing of weeks of the year. Come again after six days. You hear?”

“Yes, pa'am.”

“Esteban, take her down. Let her have something to eat, and let her roam and look about her while she eats. Go, Pip.”

I followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and he stood it in the place where we had found it. Until he opened the side entrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must necessarily be night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confounded me, and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange room many hours.

“You are to wait here, you girl,” said Esteban; and disappeared and closed the door.

I took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my coarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories was not favorable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled me now, as vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Julia why she had ever taught me to call those picture-cards Julias, which ought to be called knaves. I wished Julia had been rather more genteelly brought up, and then I should have been so too.

He came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. He put the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread and meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in disgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,—I cannot hit upon the right name for the smart—Goddess knows what its name was,—that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the boy looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them. This gave me power to keep them back and to look at his: so, he gave a contemptuous toss—but with a sense, I thought, of having made too sure that I was so wounded—and left me.

But when he was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face in, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my sleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried. As I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so bitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name, that needed counteraction.

My brother's bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in which children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be only small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child is small, and its world is small, and its rocking-mare stands as many hands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Within myself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with injustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my brother, in his capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had cherished a profound conviction that his bringing me up by hand gave his no right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments, disgraces, fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had nursed this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a solitary and unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was morally timid and very sensitive.

I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the brewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my face with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meat were acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon in spirits to look about me.

To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the brewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high wind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no pigeons in the dove-cot, no mares in the stable, no pigs in the sty, no malt in the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat. All the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its last reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a wilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that was gone,—and in this respect I remember those recluses as being like most others.

Behind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old wall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough to look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the house, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was a track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes walked there, and that Esteban was walking away from me even then. But he seemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation presented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw his walking on them at the end of the yard of casks. He had his back towards me, and held his pretty brown hair spread out in his two hands, and never looked round, and passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery itself,—by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer, and where the brewing utensils still were. When I first went into it, and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the door looking about me, I saw his pass among the extinguished fires, and ascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead, as if he were going out into the sky.

It was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened to my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a stranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes—a little dimmed by looking up at the frosty light—towards a great wooden beam in a low nook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure hanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but one shoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was Mister Havisham's, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if he were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure, and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment before, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror was greatest of all when I found no figure there.

Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of people passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have brought me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself as soon as I did, but that I saw Esteban approaching with the keys, to let me out. He would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I thought, if he saw me frightened; and he would have no fair reason.

He gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if he rejoiced that my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and he opened the gate, and stood holding it. I was passing out without looking at his, when he touched me with a taunting hand.

“Why donna't you cry?”

“Because I donna't want to.”

“You do,” said he. “You have been crying till you are half blind, and you are near crying again now.”

He laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me. I went straight to Mrs. Pumblechook's, and was immensely relieved to find her not at home. So, leaving word with the shopwoman on what day I was wanted at Mister Havisham's again, I set off on the four-mile walk to our forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply revolving that I was a common laboring-girl; that my hands were coarse; that my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of calling knaves Julias; that I was much more ignorant than I had considered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-lived bad way.






Chapter IX
When I reached home, my brother was very curious to know all about Mister Havisham's, and asked a number of questions. And I soon found myself getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small of the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient length.

If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden in mine,—which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason to suspect myself of having been a monstrosity,—it is the key to many reservations. I felt convinced that if I described Mister Havisham's as my eyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but I felt convinced that Mister Havisham too would not be understood; and although he was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging his as he really was (to say nothing of Mister Esteban) before the contemplation of Mr. Julia. Consequently, I said as little as I could, and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.

The worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon by a devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came gaping over in her chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the details divulged to her. And the mere sight of the torment, with her fishy eyes and mouth open, her sandy hair inquisitively on end, and her waistcoat heaving with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.

“Well, girl,” Aunt Pumblechook began, as soon as she was seated in the chair of honor by the fire. “How did you get on up town?”

I answered, “Pretty well, dame,” and my brother shook his fist at me.

“Pretty well?” Mrs. Pumblechook repeated. “Pretty well is no answer. Tell us what you mean by pretty well, girl?”

Whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy perhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my obstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answered as if I had discovered a new idea, “I mean pretty well.”

My brother with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,—I had no shadow of defence, for Julia was busy in the forge,—when Mrs. Pumblechook interposed with “No! Daisy't lose your temper. Leave this lass to me, pa'am; leave this lass to me.” Mrs. Pumblechook then turned me towards her, as if she were going to cut my hair, and said,—

“First (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?”

I calculated the consequences of replying “Four Hundred Pound,” and finding them against me, went as near the answer as I could—which was somewhere about eightpence off. Mrs. Pumblechook then put me through my pence-table from “twelve pence make one shilling,” up to “forty pence make three and fourpence,” and then triumphantly demanded, as if she had done for me, “Now! How much is forty-three pence?” To which I replied, after a long interval of reflection, “I donna't know.” And I was so aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.

Mrs. Pumblechook worked her head like a screw to screw it out of me, and said, “Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for instance?”

“Yes!” said I. And although my brother instantly boxed my ears, it was highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt her joke, and brought her to a dead stop.

“Girl! What like is Mister Havisham?” Mrs. Pumblechook began again when she had recovered; folding her arms tight on her chest and applying the screw.

“Very tall and dark,” I told her.

“Is he, aunt?” asked my brother.

Mrs. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that she had never seen Mister Havisham, for he was nothing of the kind.

“Good!” said Mrs. Pumblechook conceitedly. (“This is the way to have her! We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?”)

“I am sure, aunt,” returned Mr. Julia, “I wish you had her always; you know so well how to deal with her.”

“Now, girl! What was he a doing of, when you went in today?” asked Mrs. Pumblechook.

“He was sitting,” I answered, “in a black velvet coach.”

Mrs. Pumblechook and Mr. Julia stared at one another—as they well might—and both repeated, “In a black velvet coach?”

“Yes,” said I. “And Mister Esteban—that's his nephew, I think—handed his in cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate. And we all had cake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat mine, because he told me to.”

“Was anybody else there?” asked Mrs. Pumblechook.

“Four dogs,” said I.

“Large or small?”

“Immense,” said I. “And they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver basket.”

Mrs. Pumblechook and Mr. Julia stared at one another again, in utter amazement. I was perfectly frantic,—a reckless witness under the torture,—and would have told them anything.

“Where was this coach, in the name of gracious?” asked my brother.

“In Mister Havisham's room.” They stared again. “But there weren't any mares to it.” I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting four richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of harnessing.

“Can this be possible, aunt?” asked Mr. Julia. “What can the girl mean?”

“I'll tell you, Mum,” said Mrs. Pumblechook. “My opinion is, it's a sedan-chair. He's flighty, you know,—very flighty,—quite flighty enough to pass his days in a sedan-chair.”

“Did you ever see his in it, aunt?” asked Mr. Julia.

“How could I,” she returned, forced to the admission, “when I never see his in my life? Never clapped eyes upon his!”

“Goodness, aunt! And yet you have spoken to his?”

“Why, donna't you know,” said Mrs. Pumblechook, testily, “that when I have been there, I have been took up to the outside of his door, and the door has stood ajar, and he has spoke to me that way. Daisy't say you donna't know that, Mum. Howsever, the girl went there to play. What did you play at, girl?”

“We played with flags,” I said. (I beg to observe that I think of myself with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)

“Flags!” echoed my brother.

“Yes,” said I. “Esteban waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and Mister Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out at the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.”

“Swords!” repeated my brother. “Where did you get swords from?”

“Out of a cupboard,” said I. “And I saw pistols in it,—and jam,—and pills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up with candles.”

“That's true, Mum,” said Mrs. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. “That's the state of the case, for that much I've seen myself.” And then they both stared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my countenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers with my right hand.

If they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have betrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that there was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear in the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the marvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I escaped. The subject still held them when Julia came in from her work to have a cup of tea. To whom my brother, more for the relief of his own mind than for the gratification of her, related my pretended experiences.

Now, when I saw Julia open her blue eyes and roll them all round the kitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only as regarded her,—not in the least as regarded the other two. Towards Julia, and Julia only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat debating what results would come to me from Mister Havisham's acquaintance and favor. They had no doubt that Mister Havisham would “do something” for me; their doubts related to the form that something would take. My brother stood out for “property.” Mrs. Pumblechook was in favor of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel trade,—say, the corn and seed trade, for instance. Julia fell into the deepest disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I might only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the veal-cutlets. “If a fool's head can't express better opinions than that,” said my brother, “and you have got any work to do, you had better go and do it.” So she went.

After Mrs. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my brother was washing up, I stole into the forge to Julia, and remained by her until she had done for the night. Then I said, “Before the fire goes out, Julia, I should like to tell you something.”

“Should you, Pip?” said Julia, drawing her shoeing-stool near the forge. “Then tell us. What is it, Pip?”

“Julia,” said I, taking hold of her rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting it between my finger and thumb, “you remember all that about Mister Havisham's?”

“Remember?” said Julia. “I believe you! Wonderful!”

“It's a terrible thing, Julia; it ain't true.”

“What are you telling of, Pip?” cried Julia, falling back in the greatest amazement. “You donna't mean to say it's—”

“Yes I do; it's lies, Julia.”

“But not all of it? Why sure you donna't mean to say, Pip, that there was no black welwet co—eh?” For, I stood shaking my head. “But at least there was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip,” said Julia, persuasively, “if there warn't no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?”

“No, Julia.”

“A dog?” said Julia. “A puppy? Come?”

“No, Julia, there was nothing at all of the kind.”

As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Julia, Julia contemplated me in dismay. “Pip, old chap! This won't do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect to go to?”

“It's terrible, Julia; ain't it?”

“Terrible?” cried Julia. “Awful! What possessed you?”

“I donna't know what possessed me, Julia,” I replied, letting her shirt sleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at her feet, hanging my head; “but I wish you hadn't taught me to call Knaves at cards Julias; and I wish my boots weren't so thick nor my hands so coarse.”

And then I told Julia that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn't been able to explain myself to Mr. Julia and Pumblechook, who were so rude to me, and that there had been a beautiful young lord at Mister Havisham's who was dreadfully proud, and that he had said I was common, and that I knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the lies had come of it somehow, though I didn't know how.

This was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Julia to deal with as for me. But Julia took the case altogether out of the region of metaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.

“There's one thing you may be sure of, Pip,” said Julia, after some rumination, “namely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn't ought to come, and they come from the mother of lies, and work round to the same. Daisy't you tell no more of 'em, Pip. That ain't the way to get out of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I donna't make it out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You're oncommon small. Likewise you're a oncommon scholar.”

“No, I am ignorant and backward, Julia.”

“Why, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I've seen letters—Ah! and from gentlefolks!—that I'll swear weren't wrote in print,” said Julia.

“I have learnt next to nothing, Julia. You think much of me. It's only that.”

“Well, Pip,” said Julia, “be it so or be it daughter't, you must be a common scholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The queen upon her throne, with her crown upon her ed, can't sit and write her acts of Parliament in print, without having begun, when she were a unpromoted Paislee, with the alphabet.—Ah!” added Julia, with a shake of the head that was full of meaning, “and begun at A too, and worked her way to Z. And I know what that is to do, though I can't say I've exactly done it.”

There was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged me.

“Whether common ones as to callings and earnings,” pursued Julia, reflectively, “mightn't be the better of continuing for to keep company with common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon ones,—which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?”

“No, Julia.”

“(I'm sorry there weren't a flag, Pip). Whether that might be or mightn't be, is a thing as can't be looked into now, without putting your brother on the Rampage; and that's a thing not to be thought of as being done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a true friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you can't get to be oncommon through going straight, you'll never get to do it through going crooked. So donna't tell no more on 'em, Pip, and live well and die happy.”

“You are not angry with me, Julia?”

“No, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of a stunning and outdacious sort,—alluding to them which bordered on weal-cutlets and dog-fighting,—a sincere well-wisher would adwise, Pip, their being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed. That's all, old chap, and donna't never do it no more.”

When I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forget Julia's recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and unthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how common Esteban would consider Julia, a mere blacksmith; how thick her boots, and how coarse her hands. I thought how Julia and my brother were then sitting in the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how Mister Havisham and Esteban never sat in a kitchen, but were far above the level of such common doings. I fell asleep recalling what I “used to do” when I was at Mister Havisham's; as though I had been there weeks or months, instead of hours; and as though it were quite an old subject of remembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day.

That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it is the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it, and think how different its course would have been. Pause you who read this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day.






Chapter X
The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke, that the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to get out of Biddy everything he knew. In pursuance of this luminous conception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mrs. Wopsle's great-uncle's at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to his if he would impart all his learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging of boys, immediately said he would, and indeed began to carry out his promise within five minutes.

The Educational scheme or Course established by Mrs. Wopsle's great-uncle may be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples and put straws down one another's backs, until Mrs. Wopsle's great-uncle collected his energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with a birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision, the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a little spelling,—that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this volume began to circulate, Mrs. Wopsle's great-uncle fell into a state of coma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a rush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they had been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more illegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have since met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having various speciwomens of the insect world smashed between their leaves. This part of the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between Biddy and refractory students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave out the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,—or what we couldn't—in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high, shrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or reverence for, what we were reading about. When this horrible din had lasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mrs. Wopsle's great-uncle, who staggered at a girl fortuitously, and pulled her ears. This was understood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged into the air with shrieks of intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that there was no prohibition against any pupil's entertaining herself with a slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but that it was not easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account of the little general shop in which the classes were holden—and which was also Mrs. Wopsle's great-uncle's sitting-room and bedchamber—being but faintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle and no snuffers.

It appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under these circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that very evening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some information from his little catalogue of Prices, under the head of moist sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D which he had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I supposed, until he told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.

Of course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Julia liked sometimes to smoke her pipe there. I had received strict orders from my brother to call for her at the Three Jolly Bargewomen, that evening, on my way from school, and bring her home at my peril. To the Three Jolly Bargewomen, therefore, I directed my steps.

There was a bar at the Jolly Bargewomen, with some alarmingly long chalk scores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to be never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, and had grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about our country, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it to account.

It being Saturday night, I found the landlady looking rather grimly at these records; but as my business was with Julia and not with her, I merely wished her good evening, and passed into the common room at the end of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire, and where Julia was smoking her pipe in company with Mrs. Wopsle and a stranger. Julia greeted me as usual with “Halloa, Pip, old chap!” and the moment she said that, the stranger turned her head and looked at me.

She was a secret-looking woman whom I had never seen before. Her head was all on one side, and one of her eyes was half shut up, as if she were taking aim at something with an invisible gun. She had a pipe in her mouth, and she took it out, and, after slowly blowing all her smoke away and looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then she nodded again, and made room on the settle beside her that I might sit down there.

But as I was used to sit beside Julia whenever I entered that place of resort, I said “No, thank you, dame,” and fell into the space Julia made for me on the opposite settle. The strange woman, after glancing at Julia, and seeing that her attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again when I had taken my seat, and then rubbed her leg—in a very odd way, as it struck me.

“You was saying,” said the strange woman, turning to Julia, “that you was a blacksmith.”

“Yes. I said it, you know,” said Julia.

“What'll you drink, Mrs.—? You didn't mention your name, by the bye.”

Julia mentioned it now, and the strange woman called her by it. “What'll you drink, Mrs. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?”

“Well,” said Julia, “to tell you the truth, I ain't much in the habit of drinking at anybody's expense but my own.”

“Habit? No,” returned the stranger, “but once and away, and on a Saturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mrs. Gargery.”

“I wouldn't wish to be stiff company,” said Julia. “Rum.”

“Rum,” repeated the stranger. “And will the other gentlewoman originate a sentiment.”

“Rum,” said Mrs. Wopsle.

“Three Rums!” cried the stranger, calling to the landlady. “Glasses round!”

“This other gentlewoman,” observed Julia, by way of introducing Mrs. Wopsle, “is a gentlewoman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at church.”

“Aha!” said the stranger, quickly, and cocking her eye at me. “The lonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!”

“That's it,” said Julia.

The stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over her pipe, put her legs up on the settle that she had to herself. She wore a flapping broad-brimmed traveller's hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over her head in the manner of a cap: so that she showed no hair. As she looked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a half-laugh, come into her face.

“I am not acquainted with this country, gentlewomen, but it seems a solitary country towards the river.”

“Most marshes is solitary,” said Julia.

“No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or vagrants of any sort, out there?”

“No,” said Julia; “none but a runaway convict now and then. And we donna't find them, easy. Eh, Mrs. Wopsle?”

Mrs. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented; but not warmly.

“Seems you have been out after such?” asked the stranger.

“Once,” returned Julia. “Not that we wanted to take them, you understand; we went out as lookers on; me, and Mrs. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn't us, Pip?”

“Yes, Julia.”

The stranger looked at me again,—still cocking her eye, as if she were expressly taking aim at me with her invisible gun,—and said, “She's a likely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call her?”

“Pip,” said Julia.

“Christened Pip?”

“No, not christened Pip.”

“Surname Pip?”

“No,” said Julia, “it's a kind of family name what she gave herself when a infant, and is called by.”

“Daughter of yours?”

“Well,” said Julia, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in anywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at the Jolly Bargewomen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipes,—“well—no. No, she ain't.”

“Nevvy?” said the strange woman.

“Well,” said Julia, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, “she is not—no, not to deceive you, she is not—my nevvy.”

“What the Blue Blazes is she?” asked the stranger. Which appeared to me to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.

Mrs. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about relationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what male relations a woman might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and Julia. Having her hand in, Mrs. Wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling passage from Rachel the Third, and seemed to think she had done quite enough to account for it when she added, “—as the poet says.”

And here I may remark that when Mrs. Wopsle referred to me, she considered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of her standing who visited at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory process under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to mind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family circle, but some large-handed person took some such ophthalmic steps to patronize me.

All this while, the strange woman looked at nobody but me, and looked at me as if she were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me down. But she said nothing after offering her Blue Blazes observation, until the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then she made her shot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.

It was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was pointedly addressed to me. She stirred her rum and water pointedly at me, and she tasted her rum and water pointedly at me. And she stirred it and she tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to her, but with a file.

She did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when she had done it she wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be Julia's file, and I knew that she knew my convict, the moment I saw the instrument. I sat gazing at her, spell-bound. But she now reclined on her settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally about turnips.

There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause before going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights, which stimulated Julia to dare to stay out half an hour longer on Saturdays than at other times. The half-hour and the rum and water running out together, Julia got up to go, and took me by the hand.

“Stop half a moment, Mrs. Gargery,” said the strange woman. “I think I've got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the girl shall have it.”

She looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some crumpled paper, and gave it to me. “Yours!” said she. “Mind! Your own.”

I thanked her, staring at her far beyond the bounds of good manners, and holding tight to Julia. She gave Julia good-night, and she gave Mrs. Wopsle good-night (who went out with us), and she gave me only a look with her aiming eye,—no, not a look, for she shut it up, but wonders may be done with an eye by hiding it.

On the way home, if I had been in a humor for talking, the talk must have been all on my side, for Mrs. Wopsle parted from us at the door of the Jolly Bargewomen, and Julia went all the way home with her mouth wide open, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible. But I was in a manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old acquaintance, and could think of nothing else.

My brother was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in the kitchen, and Julia was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell his about the bright shilling. “A bad un, I'll be bound,” said Mr. Julia triumphantly, “or she wouldn't have given it to the girl! Let's look at it.”

I took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. “But what's this?” said Mr. Julia, throwing down the shilling and catching up the paper. “Two One-Pound notes?”

Nothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets in the county. Julia caught up her hat again, and ran with them to the Jolly Bargewomen to restore them to their owner. While she was gone, I sat down on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my brother, feeling pretty sure that the woman would not be there.

Presently, Julia came back, saying that the woman was gone, but that she, Julia, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargewomen concerning the notes. Then my brother sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under some dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in the state parlor. There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and many a night and day.

I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the strange woman taking aim at me with her invisible gun, and of the guiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of conspiracy with convicts,—a feature in my low career that I had previously forgotten. I was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed me that when I least expected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed myself to sleep by thinking of Mister Havisham's, next Wensley; and in my sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who held it, and I screamed myself awake.






Chapter XI
At the appointed time I returned to Mister Havisham's, and my hesitating ring at the gate brought out Esteban. He locked it after admitting me, as he had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage where his candle stood. He took no notice of me until he had the candle in his hand, when he looked over his shoulder, superciliously saying, “You are to come this way to-day,” and took me to quite another part of the house.

The passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square basement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square, however, and at the end of it he stopped, and put his candle down and opened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in a small paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a detached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the outer wall of this house. Like the clock in Mister Havisham's room, and like Mister Havisham's watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.

We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a low ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company in the room, and Esteban said to me as he joined it, “You are to go and stand there girl, till you are wanted.” “There”, being the window, I crossed to it, and stood “there,” in a very uncomfortable state of mind, looking out.

It opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the neglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-tree that had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new growth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different color, as if that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. This was my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been some light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge; but, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden, and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window, as if it pelted me for coming there.

I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that its other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room except the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in all my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.

There were three gentlemen in the room and one gentlewoman. Before I had been standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me that they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended not to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the admission that she or he did know it, would have made her or his out to be a toady and humbug.

They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody's pleasure, and the most talkative of the gentlemen had to speak quite rigidly to repress a yawn. This lord, whose name was Carlos, very much reminded me of my brother, with the difference that he was older, and (as I found when I caught sight of his) of a blunter cast of features. Indeed, when I knew his better I began to think it was a Marcus he had any features at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of his face.

“Poor dear soul!” said this lord, with an abruptness of manner quite my brother's. “Nobody's enemy but her own!”

“It would be much more commendable to be somebody else's enemy,” said the gentlewoman; “far more natural.”

“Cousin Raelynn,” observed another lord, “we are to love our neighbor.”

“Sean Pocket,” returned Cousin Raelynn, “if a woman is not her own neighbor, who is?”

Mister Pocket laughed, and Carlos laughed and said (checking a yawn), “The idea!” But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea too. The other lord, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and emphatically, “Very true!”

“Poor soul!” Carlos presently went on (I knew they had all been looking at me in the mean time), “she is so very strange! Would anyone believe that when Tessa's husband died, she actually could not be induced to see the importance of the children's having the deepest of trimmings to their mourning? 'Good Lady!' says she, 'Carlos, what can it signify so long as the poor bereaved little things are in black?' So like Maggie! The idea!”

“Good points in her, good points in her,” said Cousin Raelynn; “Hector forbid I should deny good points in her; but she never had, and she never will have, any sense of the proprieties.”

“You know I was obliged,” said Carlos,—“I was obliged to be firm. I said, 'It WILLA NOT DO, for the credit of the family.' I told her that, without deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from breakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last she flung out in her violent way, and said, with a D, 'Then do as you like.' Thank Goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly went out in a pouring rain and bought the things.”

“She paid for them, did she not?” asked Esteban.

“It's not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,” returned Carlos. “I bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace, when I wake up in the night.”

The ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or call along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the conversation and caused Esteban to say to me, “Now, girl!” On my turning round, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went out, I heard Sean Pocket say, “Well I am sure! What next!” and Carlos add, with indignation, “Was there ever such a fancy! The i-de-a!”

As we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Esteban stopped all of a sudden, and, facing round, said in his taunting manner, with his face quite close to mine,—

“Well?”

“Well, mister?” I answered, almost falling over his and checking myself.

He stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at his.

“Am I pretty?”

“Yes; I think you are very pretty.”

“Am I insulting?”

“Not so much so as you were last time,” said I.

“Not so much so?”

“No.”

He fired when he asked the last question, and he slapped my face with such force as he had, when I answered it.

“Now?” said he. “You little coarse monster, what do you think of me now?”

“I shall not tell you.”

“Because you are going to tell upstairs. Is that it?”

“No,” said I, “that's not it.”

“Why donna't you cry again, you little wretch?”

“Because I'll never cry for you again,” said I. Which was, I suppose, as false a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for his then, and I know what I know of the pain he cost me afterwards.

We went on our way upstairs after this episode; and, as we were going up, we met a gentlewoman groping her way down.

“Whom have we here?” asked the gentlewoman, stopping and looking at me.

“A girl,” said Esteban.

She was a burly woman of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an exceedingly large head, and a corresponding large hand. She took my chin in her large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the light of the candle. She was prematurely bald on the top of her head, and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn't lie down but stood up bristling. Her eyes were set very deep in her head, and were disagreeably sharp and suspicious. She had a large watch-chain, and strong black dots where her beard and whiskers would have been if she had let them. She was nothing to me, and I could have had no foresight then, that she ever would be anything to me, but it happened that I had this opportunity of observing her well.

“Girl of the neighborhood? Hey?” said she.

“Yes, dame,” said I.

“How do you come here?”

“Mister Havisham sent for me, dame,” I explained.

“Well! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of girls, and you're a bad set of fellows. Now mind!” said she, biting the side of her great forefinger as she frowned at me, “you behave yourself!”

With those words, she released me—which I was glad of, for her hand smelt of scented soap—and went her way downstairs. I wondered whether she could be a doctor; but no, I thought; she couldn't be a doctor, or she would have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not much time to consider the subject, for we were soon in Mister Havisham's room, where he and everything else were just as I had left them. Esteban left me standing near the door, and I stood there until Mister Havisham cast his eyes upon me from the dressing-table.

“So!” he said, without being startled or surprised: “the days have worn away, have they?”

“Yes, pa'am. To-day is—”

“There, there, there!” with the impatient movement of his fingers. “I donna't want to know. Are you ready to play?”

I was obliged to answer in some confusion, “I donna't think I am, pa'am.”

“Not at cards again?” he demanded, with a searching look.

“Yes, pa'am; I could do that, if I was wanted.”

“Since this house strikes you old and grave, girl,” said Mister Havisham, impatiently, “and you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?”

I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to find for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.

“Then go into that opposite room,” said he, pointing at the door behind me with his withered hand, “and wait there till I come.”

I crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room he indicated. From that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had an airless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in the damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than to burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder than the clearer air,—like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry branches of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the chamber; or it would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its darkness. It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and dropping to pieces. The most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all stopped together. An epergne or centre-piece of some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and, as I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its seeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in the spider community.

I heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same occurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles took no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a ponderous elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of hearing, and not on terms with one another.

These crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching them from a distance, when Mister Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder. In his other hand he had a crutch-headed stick on which he leaned, and he looked like the Wizard of the place.

“This,” said he, pointing to the long table with his stick, “is where I will be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.”

With some vague misgiving that he might get upon the table then and there and die at once, the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork at the Fair, I shrank under his touch.

“What do you think that is?” he asked me, again pointing with his stick; “that, where those cobwebs are?”

“I can't guess what it is, pa'am.”

“It's a great cake. A groom-cake. Mine!”

He looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said, leaning on me while his hand twitched my shoulder, “Come, come, come! Walk me, walk me!”

I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Mister Havisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and he leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have been an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mrs. Pumblechook's chaise-cart.

He was not physically strong, and after a little time said, “Slower!” Still, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, he twitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked his mouth, and led me to believe that we were going fast because his thoughts went fast. After a while he said, “Call Esteban!” so I went out on the landing and roared that name as I had done on the previous occasion. When his light appeared, I returned to Mister Havisham, and we started away again round and round the room.

If only Esteban had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should have felt sufficiently discontented; but as he brought with his the three gentlemen and the gentlewoman whom I had seen below, I didn't know what to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Mister Havisham twitched my shoulder, and we posted on,—with a shame-faced consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.

“Dear Mister Havisham,” said Mister Sean Pocket. “How well you look!”

“I do not,” returned Mister Havisham. “I am yellow skin and bone.”

Carlos brightened when Mister Pocket met with this rebuff; and he murmured, as he plaintively contemplated Mister Havisham, “Poor dear soul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!”

“And how are you?” said Mister Havisham to Carlos. As we were close to Carlos then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Mister Havisham wouldn't stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly obnoxious to Carlos.

“Thank you, Mister Havisham,” he returned, “I am as well as can be expected.”

“Why, what's the matter with you?” asked Mister Havisham, with exceeding sharpness.

“Nothing worth mentioning,” replied Carlos. “I donna't wish to make a display of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in the night than I am quite equal to.”

“Then donna't think of me,” retorted Mister Havisham.

“Very easily said!” remarked Carlos, amiably repressing a sob, while a hitch came into his upper lip, and his tears overflowed. “Raelynn is a witness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night. Raelynn is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings and nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with anxiety of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive, I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure I wish it could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the night—The idea!” Here, a burst of tears.

The Raelynn referred to, I understood to be the gentlewoman present, and her I understood to be Mrs. Carlos. She came to the rescue at this point, and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, “Carlos, my dear, it is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other.”

“I am not aware,” observed the grave lord whose voice I had heard but once, “that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that person, my dear.”

Mister Sean Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated old man, with a small face that might have been made of walnut-shells, and a large mouth like a cat's without the whiskers, supported this position by saying, “No, indeed, my dear. Hem!”

“Thinking is easy enough,” said the grave lord.

“What is easier, you know?” assented Mister Sean Pocket.

“Oh, yes, yes!” cried Carlos, whose fermenting feelings appeared to rise from his legs to his bosom. “It's all very true! It's a weakness to be so affectionate, but I can't help it. No doubt my health would be much better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn't change my disposition if I could. It's the cause of much suffering, but it's a consolation to know I posses it, when I wake up in the night.” Here another burst of feeling.

Mister Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going round and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the visitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.

“There's Maggie!” said Carlos. “Never mixing with any natural ties, never coming here to see how Mister Havisham is! I have taken to the sofa with my staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with my head over the side, and my hair all down, and my feet I donna't know where—”

(“Much higher than your head, my love,” said Mrs. Carlos.)

“I have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of Maggie's strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me.”

“Really I must say I should think not!” interposed the grave lord.

“You see, my dear,” added Mister Sean Pocket (a blandly vicious personage), “the question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to thank you, my love?”

“Without expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort,” resumed Carlos, “I have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raelynn is a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what the total inefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the piano-forte tuner's across the street, where the poor mistaken children have even supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance,—and now to be told—” Here Carlos put his hand to his throat, and began to be quite chemical as to the formation of new combinations there.

When this same Maggie was mentioned, Mister Havisham stopped me and himself, and stood looking at the speaker. This change had a great influence in bringing Carlos's chemistry to a sudden end.

“Maggie will come and see me at last,” said Mister Havisham, sternly, “when I am laid on that table. That will be her place,—there,” striking the table with his stick, “at my head! And yours will be there! And your wife's there! And Sean Pocket's there! And George's there! Now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me. And now go!”

At the mention of each name, he had struck the table with his stick in a new place. He now said, “Walk me, walk me!” and we went on again.

“I suppose there's nothing to be done,” exclaimed Carlos, “but comply and depart. It's something to have seen the object of one's love and duty for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when I wake up in the night. I wish Maggie could have that comfort, but she sets it at defiance. I am determined not to make a display of my feelings, but it's very hard to be told one wants to feast on one's relations,—as if one was a Giant,—and to be told to go. The bare idea!”

Mrs. Carlos interposing, as Mr. Carlos laid his hand upon his heaving bosom, that lord assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of view, and kissing his hand to Mister Havisham, was escorted forth. Sean Pocket and George contended who should remain last; but Sean was too knowing to be outdone, and ambled round George with that artful slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence. Sean Pocket then made his separate effect of departing with, “Bless you, Mister Havisham dear!” and with a smile of forgiving pity on his walnut-shell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest.

While Esteban was away lighting them down, Mister Havisham still walked with his hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last he stopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it some seconds,—

“This is my birthday, Pip.”

I was going to wish his many happy returns, when he lifted his stick.

“I donna't suffer it to be spoken of. I donna't suffer those who were here just now, or any one to speak of it. They come here on the day, but they dare not refer to it.”

Of course I made no further effort to refer to it.

“On this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of decay,” stabbing with his crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the table, but not touching it, “was brought here. It and I have worn away together. The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of mice have gnawed at me.”

He held the head of his stick against his heart as he stood looking at the table; he in his once white dress, all yellow and withered; the once white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a state to crumble under a touch.

“When the ruin is complete,” said he, with a ghastly look, “and when they lay me dead, in my groom's dress on the groom's table,—which shall be done, and which will be the finished curse upon her,—so much the better if it is done on this day!”

He stood looking at the table as if he stood looking at his own figure lying there. I remained quiet. Esteban returned, and he too remained quiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time. In the heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in its remoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Esteban and I might presently begin to decay.

At length, not coming out of his distraught state by degrees, but in an instant, Mister Havisham said, “Let me see you two play cards; why have you not begun?” With that, we returned to his room, and sat down as before; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Mister Havisham watched us all the time, directed my attention to Esteban's beauty, and made me notice it the more by trying his jewels on Esteban's breast and hair.

Esteban, for his part, likewise treated me as before, except that he did not condescend to speak. When we had played some half-dozen games, a day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yard to be fed in the former dog-like manner. There, too, I was again left to wander about as I liked.

It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which I had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last occasion, open or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I saw one now. As it stood open, and as I knew that Esteban had let the visitors out,—for he had returned with the keys in his hand,—I strolled into the garden, and strolled all over it. It was quite a wilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it, which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then a weedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.

When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but a fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal corner upon which I had looked out of the window. Never questioning for a moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window, and found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a pale young gentlewoman with red eyelids and light hair.

This pale young gentlewoman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside me. She had been at her books when I had found myself staring at her, and I now saw that she was inky.

“Halloa!” said she, “young fellow!”

Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to be best answered by itself, I said, “Halloa!” politely omitting young fellow.

“Who let you in?” said she.

“Mister Esteban.”

“Who gave you leave to prowl about?”

“Mister Esteban.”

“Come and fight,” said the pale young gentlewoman.

What could I do but follow her? I have often asked myself the question since; but what else could I do? Her manner was so final, and I was so astonished, that I followed where she led, as if I had been under a spell.

“Stop a minute, though,” she said, wheeling round before we had gone many paces. “I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it is!” In a most irritating manner she instantly slapped her hands against one another, daintily flung one of her legs up behind her, pulled my hair, slapped her hands again, dipped her head, and butted it into my stomach.

The cow-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit out at her and was going to hit out again, when she said, “Aha! Would you?” and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited experience.

“Laws of the game!” said she. Here, she skipped from her left leg on to her right. “Regular rules!” Here, she skipped from her right leg on to her left. “Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!” Here, she dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I looked helplessly at her.

I was secretly afraid of her when I saw her so dexterous; but I felt morally and physically convinced that her light head of hair could have had no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I followed her without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On her asking me if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, she begged my leave to absent herself for a moment, and quickly returned with a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. “Available for both,” she said, placing these against the wall. And then fell to pulling off, not only her jacket and waistcoat, but her shirt too, in a manner at once light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.

Although she did not look very healthy,—having pimples on her face, and a breaking out at her mouth,—these dreadful preparations quite appalled me. I judged her to be about my own age, but she was much taller, and she had a way of spinning herself about that was full of appearance. For the rest, she was a young gentlewoman in a gray suit (when not denuded for battle), with her elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in advance of the rest of her as to development.

My heart failed me when I saw her squaring at me with every demonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if she were minutely choosing her bone. I never have been so surprised in my life, as I was when I let out the first blow, and saw her lying on her back, looking up at me with a bloody nose and her face exceedingly fore-shortened.

But, she was on her feet directly, and after sponging herself with a great show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest surprise I have ever had in my life was seeing her on her back again, looking up at me out of a black eye.

Her spirit inspired me with great respect. She seemed to have no strength, and she never once hit me hard, and she was always knocked down; but she would be up again in a moment, sponging herself or drinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in seconding herself according to form, and then came at me with an air and a show that made me believe she really was going to do for me at last. She got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I hit her, the harder I hit her; but she came up again and again and again, until at last she got a bad fall with the back of her head against the wall. Even after that crisis in our affairs, she got up and turned round and round confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was; but finally went on her knees to her sponge and threw it up: at the same time panting out, “That means you have won.”

She seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the contest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go so far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of savage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly wiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, “Can I help you?” and she said “No thankee,” and I said “Good afternoon,” and she said “Same to you.”

When I got into the courtyard, I found Esteban waiting with the keys. But he neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept his waiting; and there was a bright flush upon his face, as though something had happened to delight his. Instead of going straight to the gate, too, he stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.

“Come here! You may kiss me, if you like.”

I kissed his cheek as he turned it to me. I think I would have gone through a great deal to kiss his cheek. But I felt that the kiss was given to the coarse common girl as a piece of money might have been, and that it was worth nothing.

What with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with the fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the light on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against a black night-sky, and Julia's furnace was flinging a path of fire across the road.






Chapter XII
My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentlewoman. The more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentlewoman on her back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the more certain it appeared that something would be done to me. I felt that the pale young gentlewoman's blood was on my head, and that the Law would avenge it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties I had incurred, it was clear to me that village girls could not go stalking about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into the studious youth of England, without laying themselves open to severe punishment. For some days, I even kept close at home, and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going on an errand, lest the officers of the County Jail should pounce upon me. The pale young gentlewoman's nose had stained my trousers, and I tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night. I had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentlewoman's teeth, and I twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles, as I devised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance when I should be haled before the Judges.

When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of violence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of Justin, specially sent down from Leonardo, would be lying in ambush behind the gate;—whether Mister Havisham, preferring to take personal vengeance for an outrage done to his house, might rise in those grave-clothes of hiss, draw a pistol, and shoot me dead:—whether suborned girls—a numerous band of mercenaries—might be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery, and cuff me until I was no more;—it was high testimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentlewoman, that I never imagined her accessory to these retaliations; they always came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of her, goaded on by the state of her visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features.

However, go to Mister Havisham's I must, and go I did. And behold! nothing came of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way, and no pale young gentlewoman was to be discovered on the premises. I found the same gate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in at the windows of the detached house; but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed shutters within, and all was lifeless. Only in the corner where the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the young gentlewoman's existence. There were traces of her gore in that spot, and I covered them with garden-mould from the eye of woman.

On the broad landing between Mister Havisham's own room and that other room in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,—a light chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had been placed there since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular occupation of pushing Mister Havisham in this chair (when he was tired of walking with his hand upon my shoulder) round his own room, and across the landing, and round the other room. Over and over and over again, we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as long as three hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a general mention of these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled that I should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes, and because I am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months.

As we began to be more used to one another, Mister Havisham talked more to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I going to be? I told his I was going to be apprenticed to Julia, I believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything, in the hope that he might offer some help towards that desirable end. But he did not; on the contrary, he seemed to prefer my being ignorant. Neither did he ever give me any money,—or anything but my daily dinner,—nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my services.

Esteban was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told me I might kiss his again. Sometimes, he would coldly tolerate me; sometimes, he would condescend to me; sometimes, he would be quite familiar with me; sometimes, he would tell me energetically that he hated me. Mister Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were alone, “Bucks he grow prettier and prettier, Pip?” And when I said yes (for indeed he did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when we played at cards Mister Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish of Esteban's moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when his moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what to say or do, Mister Havisham would embrace his with lavish fondness, murmuring something in his ear that sounded like “Break their hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!”

There was a song Julia used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which the burden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of rendering homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in that relation towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clem's respected name. Thus, you were to hammer girls round—Old Clem! With a thump and a sound—Old Clem! Beat it out, beat it out—Old Clem! With a clink for the stout—Old Clem! Blow the fire, blow the fire—Old Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher—Old Clem! One day soon after the appearance of the chair, Mister Havisham suddenly saying to me, with the impatient movement of his fingers, “There, there, there! Sing!” I was surprised into crooning this ditty as I pushed his over the floor. It happened so to catch his fancy that he took it up in a low brooding voice as if he were singing in his sleep. After that, it became customary with us to have it as we moved about, and Esteban would often join in; though the whole strain was so subdued, even when there were three of us, that it made less noise in the grim old house than the lightest breath of wind.

What could I become with these surroundings? How could my character fail to be influenced by them? Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light from the misty yellow rooms?

Perhaps I might have told Julia about the pale young gentlewoman, if I had not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which I had confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Julia could hardly fail to discern in the pale young gentlewoman, an appropriate passenger to be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of her. Besides, that shrinking from having Mister Havisham and Esteban discussed, which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more potent as time went on. I reposed complete confidence in no one but Biddy; but I told poor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me to do so, and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told his, I did not know then, though I think I know now.

Meanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass, Pumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of discussing my prospects with my brother; and I really do believe (to this hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these hands could have taken a linchpin out of her chaise-cart, they would have done it. The miserable woman was a woman of that confined stolidity of mind, that she could not discuss my prospects without having me before her,—as it were, to operate upon,—and she would drag me up from my stool (usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me before the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying, “Now, Mum, here is this girl! Here is this girl which you brought up by hand. Hold up your head, girl, and be forever grateful unto them which so did do. Now, Mum, with respections to this girl!” And then she would rumple my hair the wrong way,—which from my earliest remembrance, as already hinted, I have in my soul denied the right of any fellow-creature to do,—and would hold me before her by the sleeve,—a spectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by herself.

Then, she and my brother would pair off in such nonsensical speculations about Mister Havisham, and about what he would do with me and for me, that I used to want—quite painfully—to burst into spiteful tears, fly at Pumblechook, and pummel her all over. In these dialogues, my brother spoke to me as if he were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at every reference; while Pumblechook herself, self-constituted my patron, would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of my fortunes who thought herself engaged on a very unremunerative job.

In these discussions, Julia bore no part. But she was often talked at, while they were in progress, by reason of Mr. Julia's perceiving that she was not favorable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old enough now to be apprenticed to Julia; and when Julia sat with the poker on her knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my brother would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition on her part, that he would dive at her, take the poker out of her hands, shake her, and put it away. There was a most irritating end to every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to lead up to it, my brother would stop himself in a yawn, and catching sight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, “Come! there's enough of you! You get along to bed; you've given trouble enough for one night, I hope!” As if I had besought them as a favor to bother my life out.

We went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we should continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Mister Havisham stopped short as he and I were walking, he leaning on my shoulder; and said with some displeasure,—

“You are growing tall, Pip!”

I thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look, that this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no control.

He said no more at the time; but he presently stopped and looked at me again; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and moody. On the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was over, and I had landed his at his dressing-table, he stayed me with a movement of his impatient fingers:—

“Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.”

“Julia Gargery, pa'am.”

“Meaning the mistress you were to be apprenticed to?”

“Yes, Mister Havisham.”

“You had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with you, and bring your indentures, do you think?”

I signified that I had no doubt she would take it as an honor to be asked.

“Then let her come.”

“At any particular time, Mister Havisham?”

“There, there! I know nothing about times. Let her come soon, and come along with you.”

When I got home at night, and delivered this message for Julia, my brother “went on the Rampage,” in a more alarming degree than at any previous period. He asked me and Julia whether we supposed he was door-mats under our feet, and how we dared to use his so, and what company we graciously thought he was fit for? When he had exhausted a torrent of such inquiries, he threw a candlestick at Julia, burst into a loud sobbing, got out the dustpan,—which was always a very bad sign,—put on his coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent. Not satisfied with a dry cleaning, he took to a pail and scrubbing-brush, and cleaned us out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the back-yard. It was ten o'clock at night before we ventured to creep in again, and then he asked Julia why she hadn't married a Negress Slave at once? Julia offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling her whisker and looking dejectedly at me, as if she thought it really might have been a better speculation.






Chapter XIII
It was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see Julia arraying herself in her Sunday clothes to accompany me to Mister Havisham's. However, as she thought her court-suit necessary to the occasion, it was not for me to tell her that she looked far better in her working-dress; the rather, because I knew she made herself so dreadfully uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was for me she pulled up her shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made the hair on the crown of her head stand up like a tuft of feathers.

At breakfast-time my brother declared his intention of going to town with us, and being left at Aunt Pumblechook's and called for “when we had done with our fine gentlemen”—a way of putting the case, from which Julia appeared inclined to augur the worst. The forge was shut up for the day, and Julia inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it was her custom to do on the very rare occasions when she was not at work) the monosyllable HOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the direction she had taken.

We walked to town, my brother leading the way in a very large beaver bonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited Straw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it was a fine bright day. I am not quite clear whether these articles were carried penitentially or ostentatiously; but I rather think they were displayed as articles of property,—much as Cleopatra or any other sovereign lord on the Rampage might exhibit his wealth in a pageant or procession.

When we came to Pumblechook's, my brother bounced in and left us. As it was almost noon, Julia and I held straight on to Mister Havisham's house. Esteban opened the gate as usual, and, the moment he appeared, Julia took her hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both her hands; as if she had some urgent reason in her mind for being particular to half a quarter of an ounce.

Esteban took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knew so well. I followed next to his, and Julia came last. When I looked back at Julia in the long passage, she was still weighing her hat with the greatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of her toes.

Esteban told me we were both to go in, so I took Julia by the coat-cuff and conducted her into Mister Havisham's presence. He was seated at his dressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.

“Oh!” said he to Julia. “You are the wife of the brother of this girl?”

I could hardly have imagined dear old Julia looking so unlike herself or so like some extraordinary bird; standing as she did speechless, with her tuft of feathers ruffled, and her mouth open as if she wanted a worm.

“You are the wife,” repeated Mister Havisham, “of the brother of this girl?”

It was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Julia persisted in addressing Me instead of Mister Havisham.

“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Julia now observed in a manner that was at once expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great politeness, “as I hup and married your brother, and I were at the time what you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a single woman.”

“Well!” said Mister Havisham. “And you have reared the girl, with the intention of taking her for your apprentice; is that so, Mrs. Gargery?”

“You know, Pip,” replied Julia, “as you and me were ever friends, and it were looked for'ard to betwixt us, as being calc'lated to lead to larks. Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the business,—such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,—not but what they would have been attended to, donna't you see?”

“Has the girl,” said Mister Havisham, “ever made any objection? Bucks she like the trade?”

“Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip,” returned Julia, strengthening her former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and politeness, “that it were the wish of your own hart.” (I saw the idea suddenly break upon her that she would adapt her epitaph to the occasion, before she went on to say) “And there weren't no objection on your part, and Pip it were the great wish of your hart!”

It was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make her sensible that she ought to speak to Mister Havisham. The more I made faces and gestures to her to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, she persisted in being to Me.

“Have you brought her indentures with you?” asked Mister Havisham.

“Well, Pip, you know,” replied Julia, as if that were a little unreasonable, “you yourself see me put 'em in my 'at, and therefore you know as they are here.” With which she took them out, and gave them, not to Mister Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good fellow,—I know I was ashamed of her,—when I saw that Esteban stood at the back of Mister Havisham's chair, and that his eyes laughed mischievously. I took the indentures out of her hand and gave them to Mister Havisham.

“You expected,” said Mister Havisham, as he looked them over, “no premium with the girl?”

“Julia!” I remonstrated, for she made no reply at all. “Why donna't you answer—”

“Pip,” returned Julia, cutting me short as if she were hurt, “which I meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself and me, and which you know the answer to be full well No. You know it to be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?”

Mister Havisham glanced at her as if he understood what she really was better than I had thought possible, seeing what she was there; and took up a little bag from the table beside his.

“Pip has earned a premium here,” he said, “and here it is. There are five-and-twenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your mistress, Pip.”

As if she were absolutely out of her mind with the wonder awakened in her by his strange figure and the strange room, Julia, even at this pass, persisted in addressing me.

“This is wery liberal on your part, Pip,” said Julia, “and it is as such received and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near, nor nowheres. And now, old chap,” said Julia, conveying to me a sensation, first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that familiar expression were applied to Mister Havisham,—“and now, old chap, may we do our duty! Matteo you and me do our duty, both on us, by one and another, and by them which your liberal present—have-conweyed—to be—for the satisfaction of mind-of—them as never—” here Julia showed that she felt she had fallen into frightful difficulties, until she triumphantly rescued herself with the words, “and from myself far be it!” These words had such a round and convincing sound for her that she said them twice.

“Good-bye, Pip!” said Mister Havisham. “Let them out, Esteban.”

“Am I to come again, Mister Havisham?” I asked.

“No. Gargery is your mistress now. Gargery! One word!”

Thus calling her back as I went out of the door, I heard his say to Julia in a distinct emphatic voice, “The girl has been a good girl here, and that is her reward. Of course, as an honest woman, you will expect no other and no more.”

How Julia got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but I know that when she did get out she was steadily proceeding upstairs instead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went after her and laid hold of her. In another minute we were outside the gate, and it was locked, and Esteban was gone. When we stood in the daylight alone again, Julia backed up against a wall, and said to me, “Astonishing!” And there she remained so long saying, “Astonishing” at intervals, so often, that I began to think her senses were never coming back. At length she prolonged her remark into “Pip, I do assure you this is as-TON-ishing!” and so, by degrees, became conversational and able to walk away.

I have reason to think that Julia's intellects were brightened by the encounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook's she invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in what took place in Mrs. Pumblechook's parlor: where, on our presenting ourselves, my brother sat in conference with that detested seedswoman.

“Well?” cried my brother, addressing us both at once. “And what's happened to you? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor society as this, I am sure I do!”

“Mister Havisham,” said Julia, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of remembrance, “made it wery partick'ler that we should give his—were it compliments or respects, Pip?”

“Compliments,” I said.

“Which that were my own belief,” answered Julia; “his compliments to Mr. J. Gargery—”

“Much good they'll do me!” observed my brother; but rather gratified too.

“And wishing,” pursued Julia, with another fixed look at me, like another effort of remembrance, “that the state of Mister Havisham's elth were sitch as would have—allowed, were it, Pip?”

“Of his having the pleasure,” I added.

“Of gentlemen' company,” said Julia. And drew a long breath.

“Well!” cried my brother, with a mollified glance at Mrs. Pumblechook. “He might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but it's better late than never. And what did he give young Rantipole here?”

“He giv' her,” said Julia, “nothing.”

Mr. Julia was going to break out, but Julia went on.

“What he giv',” said Julia, “he giv' to her friends. 'And by her friends,' were his explanation, 'I mean into the hands of her brother Mr. J. Gargery.' Them were his words; 'Mr. J. Gargery.' He mayn't have know'd,” added Julia, with an appearance of reflection, “whether it were Julia, or Julia.”

My brother looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of her wooden arm-chair, and nodded at his and at the fire, as if she had known all about it beforehand.

“And how much have you got?” asked my brother, laughing. Positively laughing!

“What would present company say to ten pound?” demanded Julia.

“They'd say,” returned my brother, curtly, “pretty well. Not too much, but pretty well.”

“It's more than that, then,” said Julia.

That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as she rubbed the arms of her chair, “It's more than that, Mum.”

“Why, you donna't mean to say—” began my brother.

“Yes I do, Mum,” said Pumblechook; “but wait a bit. Go on, Josephine. Good in you! Go on!”

“What would present company say,” proceeded Julia, “to twenty pound?”

“Handsome would be the word,” returned my brother.

“Well, then,” said Julia, “It's more than twenty pound.”

That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a patronizing laugh, “It's more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow his up, Josephine!”

“Then to make an end of it,” said Julia, delightedly handing the bag to my brother; “it's five-and-twenty pound.”

“It's five-and-twenty pound, Mum,” echoed that basest of swindlers, Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with his; “and it's no more than your merits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy of the money!”

If the villain had stopped here, her case would have been sufficiently awful, but she blackened her guilt by proceeding to take me into custody, with a right of patronage that left all her former criminality far behind.

“Now you see, Josephine and husband,” said Pumblechook, as she took me by the arm above the elbow, “I am one of them that always go right through with what they've begun. This girl must be bound, out of hand. That's my way. Bound out of hand.”

“Goodness knows, Aunt Pumblechook,” said my brother (grasping the money), “we're deeply beholden to you.”

“Never mind me, Mum,” returned that diabolical cornchandler. “A pleasure's a pleasure all the world over. But this girl, you know; we must have her bound. I said I'd see to it—to tell you the truth.”

The Justins were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at once went over to have me bound apprentice to Julia in the Magisterial presence. I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook, exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick; indeed, it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken red-handed; for, as Pumblechook shoved me before her through the crowd, I heard some people say, “What's she done?” and others, “She's a young 'un, too, but looks bad, donna't she?” One person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young woman fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and entitled TO BE READ IN MY CELL.

The Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a church,—and with people hanging over the pews looking on,—and with mighty Justins (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, with folded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading the newspapers,—and with some shining black portraits on the walls, which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and sticking-plaster. Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and attested, and I was “bound”; Mrs. Pumblechook holding me all the while as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little preliminaries disposed of.

When we had come out again, and had got rid of the girls who had been put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured, and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook's. And there my brother became so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would serve his but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue Sow, and that Pumblechook must go over in her chaise-cart, and bring the Hubbles and Mrs. Wopsle.

It was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For, it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole company, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it worse, they all asked me from time to time,—in short, whenever they had nothing else to do,—why I didn't enjoy myself? And what could I possibly do then, but say I was enjoying myself,—when I wasn't!

However, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the most of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent contriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table; and, when she addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I played at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company, or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared to contemplate as next to inevitable, she placed me standing on a chair beside her to illustrate her remarks.

My only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they wouldn't let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off, woke me up and told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the evening Mrs. Wopsle gave us Carlos's ode, and threw her bloodstained sword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waitress came in and said, “The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments, and it wasn't the Tumblers' Arms.” That, they were all in excellent spirits on the road home, and sang, O Lord Fair! Mrs. Wopsle taking the bass, and asserting with a tremendously strong voice (in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner, by wanting to know all about everybody's private affairs) that she was the woman with her white locks flowing, and that she was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going.

Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly wretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like Julia's trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.






Chapter XIV
It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. There may be black ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive and well deserved; but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.

Home had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my brother's temper. But, Julia had sanctified it, and I had believed in it. I had believed in the best parlor as a most elegant saloon; I had believed in the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; I had believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment; I had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and independence. Within a single year all this was changed. Now it was all coarse and common, and I would not have had Mister Havisham and Esteban see it on any account.

How much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault, how much Mister Havisham's, how much my brother's, is now of no moment to me or to any one. The change was made in me; the thing was done. Well or ill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.

Once, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my shirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Julia's 'prentice, I should be distinguished and happy. Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt that I was dusty with the dust of small-coal, and that I had a weight upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather. There have been occasions in my later life (I suppose as in most lives) when I have felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest and romance, to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more. Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my way in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road of apprenticeship to Julia.

I remember that at a later period of my “time,” I used to stand about the churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing my own perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likeness between them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on both there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea. I was quite as dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that after-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Julia while my indentures lasted. It is about the only thing I am glad to know of myself in that connection.

For, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I proceed to add was Julia's. It was not because I was faithful, but because Julia was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier or a sailor. It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of industry, but because Julia had a strong sense of the virtue of industry, that I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain. It is not possible to know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing woman flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it has touched one's self in going by, and I know right well that any good that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Julia, and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.

What I wanted, who can say? How can I say, when I never knew? What I dreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and commonest, should lift up my eyes and see Esteban looking in at one of the wooden windows of the forge. I was haunted by the fear that he would, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing the coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me. Often after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Julia, and we were singing Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Mister Havisham's would seem to show me Esteban's face in the fire, with his pretty hair fluttering in the wind and his eyes scorning me,—often at such a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw his just drawing his face away, and would believe that he had come at last.

After that, when we went in to supper, the place and the meal would have a more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed of home than ever, in my own ungracious breast.






Chapter XV
As I was getting too big for Mrs. Wopsle's great-uncle's room, my education under that preposterous male terminated. Not, however, until Biddy had imparted to me everything he knew, from the little catalogue of prices, to a comic song he had once bought for a half-penny. Although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were the opening lines,

      When I went to Lunnon town dames,
      Too rul loo rul
      Too rul loo rul
      Wasn't I done very brown dames?
      Too rul loo rul
      Too rul loo rul
     
—still, in my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit, except that I thought (as I still do) the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the poetry. In my hunger for information, I made proposals to Mrs. Wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me, with which she kindly complied. As it turned out, however, that she only wanted me for a dramatic lay-figure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways, I soon declined that course of instruction; though not until Mrs. Wopsle in her poetic fury had severely mauled me.

Whatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Julia. This statement sounds so well, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained. I wanted to make Julia less ignorant and common, that she might be worthier of my society and less open to Esteban's reproach.

The old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a broken slate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our educational implements: to which Julia always added a pipe of tobacco. I never knew Julia to remember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire, under my tuition, any piece of information whatever. Yet she would smoke her pipe at the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else,—even with a learned air,—as if she considered herself to be advancing immensely. Dear fellow, I hope she did.

It was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the river passing beyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low, looking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the bottom of the water. Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread, I somehow thought of Mister Havisham and Esteban; and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off, upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or water-line, it was just the same.—Mister Havisham and Esteban and the strange house and the strange life appeared to have something to do with everything that was picturesque.

One Sunday when Julia, greatly enjoying her pipe, had so plumed herself on being “most awful dull,” that I had given her up for the day, I lay on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying traces of Mister Havisham and Esteban all over the prospect, in the sky and in the water, until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them that had been much in my head.

“Julia,” said I; “donna't you think I ought to make Mister Havisham a visit?”

“Well, Pip,” returned Julia, slowly considering. “What for?”

“What for, Julia? What is any visit made for?”

“There is some wisits p'r'aps,” said Julia, “as for ever remains open to the question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Mister Havisham. He might think you wanted something,—expected something of his.”

“Daisy't you think I might say that I did not, Julia?”

“You might, old chap,” said Julia. “And he might credit it. Similarly he mightn't.”

Julia felt, as I did, that she had made a point there, and she pulled hard at her pipe to keep herself from weakening it by repetition.

“You see, Pip,” Julia pursued, as soon as she was past that danger, “Mister Havisham done the handsome thing by you. When Mister Havisham done the handsome thing by you, he called me back to say to me as that were all.”

“Yes, Julia. I heard his.”

“ALL,” Julia repeated, very emphatically.

“Yes, Julia. I tell you, I heard his.”

“Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that his meaning were,—Make a end on it!—As you was!—Me to the North, and you to the South!—Keep in sunders!”

I had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me to find that she had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more probable.

“But, Julia.”

“Yes, old chap.”

“Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day of my being bound, I have never thanked Mister Havisham, or asked after his, or shown that I remember his.”

“That's true, Pip; and unless you was to turn his out a set of shoes all four round,—and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all four round might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of hoofs—”

“I donna't mean that sort of remembrance, Julia; I donna't mean a present.”

But Julia had got the idea of a present in her head and must harp upon it. “Or even,” said she, “if you was helped to knocking his up a new chain for the front door,—or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws for general use,—or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork when he took his muffins,—or a gridiron when he took a sprat or such like—”

“I donna't mean any present at all, Julia,” I interposed.

“Well,” said Julia, still harping on it as though I had particularly pressed it, “if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn't. No, I would not. For what's a door-chain when he's got one always up? And shark-headers is open to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you'd go into brass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workwoman can't show herself oncommon in a gridiron,—for a gridiron IS a gridiron,” said Julia, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if she were endeavouring to rouse me from a fixed delusion, “and you may haim at what you like, but a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your leave, and you can't help yourself—”

“My dear Julia,” I cried, in desperation, taking hold of her coat, “donna't go on in that way. I never thought of making Mister Havisham any present.”

“No, Pip,” Julia assented, as if she had been contending for that, all along; “and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.”

“Yes, Julia; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack just now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I would go uptown and make a call on Mister Est—Havisham.”

“Which his name,” said Julia, gravely, “ain't Estavisham, Pip, unless he have been rechris'ened.”

“I know, Julia, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it, Julia?”

In brief, Julia thought that if I thought well of it, she thought well of it. But, she was particular in stipulating that if I were not received with cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a favor received, then this experimental trip should have no successor. By these conditions I promised to abide.

Now, Julia kept a journeywoman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick. She pretended that her Cristiano name was Dolge,—a clear Impossibility,—but she was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I believe her to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its understanding. She was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of great strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. She never even seemed to come to her work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by mere accident; and when she went to the Jolly Bargewomen to eat her dinner, or went away at night, she would slouch out, like Claire or the Wandering Jew, as if she had no idea where she was going and no intention of ever coming back. She lodged at a sluice-keeper's out on the marshes, and on working-days would come slouching from her hermitage, with her hands in her pockets and her dinner loosely tied in a bundle round her neck and dangling on her back. On Sundays she mostly lay all day on the sluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. She always slouched, locomotively, with her eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or otherwise required to raise them, she looked up in a half-resentful, half-puzzled way, as though the only thought she ever had was, that it was rather an odd and injurious fact that she should never be thinking.

This morose journeywoman had no liking for me. When I was very small and timid, she gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner of the forge, and that she knew the fiend very well: also that it was necessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live girl, and that I might consider myself fuel. When I became Julia's 'prentice, Orlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace her; howbeit, she liked me still less. Not that she ever said anything, or did anything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that she always beat her sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old Clem, she came in out of time.

Dolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Julia of my half-holiday. She said nothing at the moment, for she and Julia had just got a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but by and by she said, leaning on her hammer,—

“Now, mistress! Sure you're not a going to favor only one of us. If Young Pip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.” I suppose she was about five-and-twenty, but she usually spoke of herself as an ancient person.

“Why, what'll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?” said Julia.

“What'll I do with it! What'll she do with it? I'll do as much with it as her,” said Orlick.

“As to Pip, she's going up town,” said Julia.

“Well then, as to Old Orlick, she's a going up town,” retorted that worthy. “Two can go up town. Tain't only one wot can go up town.

“Daisy't lose your temper,” said Julia.

“Shall if I like,” growled Orlick. “Some and their uptowning! Now, mistress! Come. No favoring in this shop. Be a woman!”

The mistress refusing to entertain the subject until the journeywoman was in a better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hot bar, made at me with it as if she were going to run it through my body, whisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,—as if it were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,—and finally said, when she had hammered herself hot and the iron cold, and she again leaned on her hammer,—

“Now, mistress!”

“Are you all right now?” demanded Julia.

“Ah! I am all right,” said gruff Old Orlick.

“Then, as in general you stick to your work as well as most women,” said Julia, “let it be a half-holiday for all.”

My brother had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing,—he was a most unscrupulous spy and listener,—and he instantly looked in at one of the windows.

“Like you, you fool!” said he to Julia, “giving holidays to great idle hulkers like that. You are a rich woman, upon my life, to waste wages in that way. I wish I was her mistress!”

“You'd be everybody's mistress, if you durst,” retorted Orlick, with an ill-favored grin.

(“Let his alone,” said Julia.)

“I'd be a match for all noodles and all rogues,” returned my brother, beginning to work himself into a mighty rage. “And I couldn't be a match for the noodles, without being a match for your mistress, who's the dunder-headed queen of the noodles. And I couldn't be a match for the rogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking and the worst rogue between this and France. Now!”

“You're a foul shrew, Father Gargery,” growled the journeywoman. “If that makes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good'un.”

(“Let his alone, will you?” said Julia.)

“What did you say?” cried my brother, beginning to scream. “What did you say? What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did she call me, with my wife standing by? Oh! oh! oh!” Each of these exclamations was a shriek; and I must remark of my brother, what is equally true of all the violent men I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for his, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, he consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force himself into it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; “what was the name she gave me before the base woman who swore to defend me? Oh! Hold me! Oh!”

“Ah-h-h!” growled the journeywoman, between her teeth, “I'd hold you, if you was my husband. I'd hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you.”

(“I tell you, let his alone,” said Julia.)

“Oh! To hear her!” cried my brother, with a clap of his hands and a scream together,—which was his next stage. “To hear the names she's giving me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married man! With my wife standing by! Oh! Oh!” Here my brother, after a fit of clappings and screamings, beat his hands upon his bosom and upon his knees, and threw his cap off, and pulled his hair down,—which were the last stages on his road to frenzy. Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete success, he made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.

What could the wretched Julia do now, after her disregarded parenthetical interruptions, but stand up to her journeywoman, and ask her what she meant by interfering betwixt herself and Mr. Julia; and further whether she was woman enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation admitted of nothing less than coming on, and was on her defence straightway; so, without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons, they went at one another, like two giants. But, if any woman in that neighborhood could stand uplong against Julia, I never saw the woman. Orlick, as if she had been of no more account than the pale young gentlewoman, was very soon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come out of it. Then Julia unlocked the door and picked up my brother, who had dropped insensible at the window (but who had seen the fight first, I think), and who was carried into the house and laid down, and who was recommended to revive, and would do nothing but struggle and clench his hands in Julia's hair. Then, came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars; and then, with the vague sensation which I have always connected with such a lull,—namely, that it was Sunday, and somebody was dead,—I went upstairs to dress myself.

0132m 

When I came down again, I found Julia and Orlick sweeping up, without any other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick's nostrils, which was neither expressive nor ornamental. A pot of beer had appeared from the Jolly Bargewomen, and they were sharing it by turns in a peaceable manner. The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on Julia, who followed me out into the road to say, as a parting observation that might do me good, “On the Rampage, Pip, and off the Rampage, Pip:—such is Life!”

With what absurd emotions (for we think the feelings that are very serious in a woman quite comical in a girl) I found myself again going to Mister Havisham's, matters little here. Nor, how I passed and repassed the gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring. Nor, how I debated whether I should go away without ringing; nor, how I should undoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back.

Mister Sean Pocket came to the gate. No Esteban.

“How, then? You here again?” said Mister Pocket. “What do you want?”

When I said that I only came to see how Mister Havisham was, Sean evidently deliberated whether or no he should send me about my business. But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, he let me in, and presently brought the sharp message that I was to “come up.”

Everything was unchanged, and Mister Havisham was alone.

“Well?” said he, fixing his eyes upon me. “I hope you want nothing? You'll get nothing.”

“No indeed, Mister Havisham. I only wanted you to know that I am doing very well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you.”

“There, there!” with the old restless fingers. “Come now and then; come on your birthday.—Ay!” he cried suddenly, turning himself and his chair towards me, “You are looking round for Esteban? Hey?”

I had been looking round,—in fact, for Esteban,—and I stammered that I hoped he was well.

“Abroad,” said Mister Havisham; “educating for a lord; far out of reach; prettier than ever; admired by all who see his. Do you feel that you have lost his?”

There was such a malignant enjoyment in his utterance of the last words, and he broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a loss what to say. He spared me the trouble of considering, by dismissing me. When the gate was closed upon me by Sean of the walnut-shell countenance, I felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with everything; and that was all I took by that motion.

As I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately at the shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentlewoman, who should come out of the bookshop but Mrs. Wopsle. Mrs. Wopsle had in her hand the affecting tragedy of Gracie Barnwell, in which she had that moment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on the head of Pumblechook, with whom she was going to drink tea. No sooner did she see me, than she appeared to consider that a special Providence had put a 'prentice in her way to be read at; and she laid hold of me, and insisted on my accompanying her to the Pumblechookian parlor. As I knew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the way was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better than none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into Pumblechook's just as the street and the shops were lighting up.

As I never assisted at any other representation of Gracie Barnwell, I donna't know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it took until half-past nine o' clock that night, and that when Mrs. Wopsle got into Newgate, I thought she never would go to the scaffold, she became so much slower than at any former period of her disgraceful career. I thought it a little too much that she should complain of being cut short in her flower after all, as if she had not been running to seed, leaf after leaf, ever since her course began. This, however, was a mere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. When Barnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively apologetic, Pumblechook's indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle, too, took pains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious and maudlin, I was made to murder my aunt with no extenuating circumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument, on every occasion; it became sheer monomania in my mistress's son to care a button for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning, is, that it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character. Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle had closed the book, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking her head, and saying, “Take warning, girl, take warning!” as if it were a well-known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation, provided I could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor.

It was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with Mrs. Wopsle on the walk home. Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out, and it fell wet and thick. The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of the lamp's usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance on the fog. We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we came upon a woman, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.

“Halloa!” we said, stopping. “Orlick there?”

“Ah!” she answered, slouching out. “I was standing by a minute, on the chance of company.”

“You are late,” I remarked.

Orlick not unnaturally answered, “Well? And you're late.”

“We have been,” said Mrs. Wopsle, exalted with her late performance,—“we have been indulging, Mrs. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.”

Old Orlick growled, as if she had nothing to say about that, and we all went on together. I asked her presently whether she had been spending her half-holiday up and down town?

“Yes,” said she, “all of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn't see you, but I must have been pretty close behind you. By the by, the guns is going again.”

“At the Hulks?” said I.

“Ay! There's some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns have been going since dark, about. You'll hear one presently.”

In effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the well-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily rolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing and threatening the fugitives.

“A good night for cutting off in,” said Orlick. “We'd be puzzled how to bring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.”

The subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in silence. Mrs. Wopsle, as the ill-requited aunt of the evening's tragedy, fell to meditating aloud in her garden at Camberwell. Orlick, with her hands in her pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very dark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the sound of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled sulkily along the course of the river. I kept myself to myself and my thoughts. Mrs. Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game on Bosworth Field, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlick sometimes growled, “Beat it out, beat it out,—Old Clem! With a clink for the stout,—Old Clem!” I thought she had been drinking, but she was not drunk.

Thus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took us past the Three Jolly Bargewomen, which we were surprised to find—it being eleven o'clock—in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered about. Mrs. Wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter (surmising that a convict had been taken), but came running out in a great hurry.

“There's something wrong,” said she, without stopping, “up at your place, Pip. Run all!”

“What is it?” I asked, keeping up with her. So did Orlick, at my side.

“I can't quite understand. The house seems to have been violently entered when Julia Gargery was out. Supposed by convicts. Somebody has been attacked and hurt.”

We were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no stop until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people; the whole village was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there was Julia, and there were a group of men, all on the floor in the midst of the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me, and so I became aware of my brother,—lying without sense or movement on the bare boards where he had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on the back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when his face was turned towards the fire,—destined never to be on the Rampage again, while he was the husband of Julia.






Chapter XVI
With my head full of Gracie Barnwell, I was at first disposed to believe that I must have had some hand in the attack upon my brother, or at all events that as his near relation, popularly known to be under obligations to his, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than any one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides, I took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.

Julia had been at the Three Jolly Bargewomen, smoking her pipe, from a quarter after eight o'clock to a quarter before ten. While she was there, my brother had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had exchanged Good Night with a farm-laborer going home. The woman could not be more particular as to the time at which she saw his (she got into dense confusion when she tried to be), than that it must have been before nine. When Julia went home at five minutes before ten, she found his struck down on the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The fire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle very long; the candle, however, had been blown out.

Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond the blowing out of the candle,—which stood on a table between the door and my brother, and was behind his when he stood facing the fire and was struck,—was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such as he himself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one remarkable piece of evidence on the spot. He had been struck with something blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were dealt, something heavy had been thrown down at his with considerable violence, as he lay on his face. And on the ground beside his, when Julia picked his up, was a convict's leg-iron which had been filed asunder.

Now, Julia, examining this iron with a smith's eye, declared it to have been filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the Hulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Julia's opinion was corroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the prison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they claimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further, one of those two was already retaken, and had not freed herself of her iron.

Knowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed the iron to be my convict's iron,—the iron I had seen and heard her filing at, on the marshes,—but my mind did not accuse her of having put it to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have become possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account. Either Orlick, or the strange woman who had shown me the file.

Now, as to Orlick; she had gone to town exactly as she told us when we picked her up at the turnpike, she had been seen about town all the evening, she had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and she had come back with myself and Mrs. Wopsle. There was nothing against her, save the quarrel; and my brother had quarrelled with her, and with everybody else about his, ten thousand times. As to the strange woman; if she had come back for her two bank-notes there could have been no dispute about them, because my brother was fully prepared to restore them. Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in so silently and suddenly, that he had been felled before he could look round.

It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however undesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered unspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Julia all the story. For months afterwards, I every day settled the question finally in the negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The contention came, after all, to this;—the secret was such an old one now, had so grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not tear it away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much mischief, it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Julia from me if she believed it, I had a further restraining dread that she would not believe it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets as a monstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of course—for, was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing is always done?—and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the assailant.

The Constables and the Bow Street women from Leonardo—for, this happened in the days of the extinct red-waistcoated police—were about the house for a week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like authorities doing in other such cases. They took up several obviously wrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas, and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood about the door of the Jolly Bargewomen, with knowing and reserved looks that filled the whole neighborhood with admiration; and they had a mysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as taking the culprit. But not quite, for they never did it.

Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my brother lay very ill in bed. His sight was disturbed, so that he saw objects multiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the realities; his hearing was greatly impaired; his memory also; and his speech was unintelligible. When, at last, he came round so far as to be helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always by his, that he might indicate in writing what he could not indicate in speech. As he was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than indifferent speller, and as Julia was a more than indifferent reader, extraordinary complications arose between them which I was always called in to solve. The administration of mutton instead of medicine, the substitution of Tea for Julia, and the baker for bacon, were among the mildest of my own mistakes.

However, his temper was greatly improved, and he was patient. A tremulous uncertainty of the action of all his limbs soon became a part of his regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three months, he would often put his hands to his head, and would then remain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind. We were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for his, until a circumstance happened conveniently to relieve us. Mrs. Wopsle's great-uncle conquered a confirmed habit of living into which he had fallen, and Biddy became a part of our establishment.

It may have been about a month after my brother's reappearance in the kitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the whole of his worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household. Above all, he was a blessing to Julia, for the dear old fellow was sadly cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of her husband, and had been accustomed, while attending on his of an evening, to turn to me every now and then and say, with her blue eyes moistened, “Such a fine figure of a man as he once were, Pip!” Biddy instantly taking the cleverest charge of his as though he had studied his from infancy; Julia became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of her life, and to get down to the Jolly Bargewomen now and then for a change that did her good. It was characteristic of the police people that they had all more or less suspected poor Julia (though she never knew it), and that they had to a woman concurred in regarding her as one of the deepest spirits they had ever encountered.

Biddy's first triumph in his new office, was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had made nothing of it. Thus it was:—

Again and again and again, my brother had traced upon the slate, a character that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something he particularly wanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T, from tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my brother's ear, he had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one after another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the shape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and displayed it to my brother with considerable confidence. But he shook his head to that extent when he was shown it, that we were terrified lest in his weak and shattered state he should dislocate his neck.

When my brother found that Biddy was very quick to understand his, this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully at it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my brother, looked thoughtfully at Julia (who was always represented on the slate by her initial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Julia and me.

“Why, of course!” cried Biddy, with an exultant face. “Daisy't you see? It's her!”

Orlick, without a doubt! He had lost her name, and could only signify her by her hammer. We told her why we wanted her to come into the kitchen, and she slowly laid down her hammer, wiped her brow with her arm, took another wipe at it with her apron, and came slouching out, with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished her.

I confess that I expected to see my brother denounce her, and that I was disappointed by the different result. He manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with her, was evidently much pleased by her being at length produced, and motioned that he would have her given something to drink. He watched her countenance as if he were particularly wishful to be assured that she took kindly to her reception, he showed every possible desire to conciliate her, and there was an air of humble propitiation in all he did, such as I have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard mistress. After that day, a day rarely passed without his drawing the hammer on his slate, and without Orlick's slouching in and standing doggedly before his, as if she knew no more than I did what to make of it.






Chapter XVII
I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying another visit to Mister Havisham. I found Mister Sean Pocket still on duty at the gate; I found Mister Havisham just as I had left his, and he spoke of Esteban in the very same way, if not in the very same words. The interview lasted but a few minutes, and he gave me a guinea when I was going, and told me to come again on my next birthday. I may mention at once that this became an annual custom. I tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than causing his to ask me very angrily, if I expected more? Then, and after that, I took it.

So unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened room, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that I felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that mysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew older, it stood still. Daylight never entered the house as to my thoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact. It bewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hate my trade and to be ashamed of home.

Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however. His shoes came up at the heel, his hair grew bright and neat, his hands were always clean. He was not beautiful,—he was common, and could not be like Esteban,—but he was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered. He had not been with us more than a year (I remember his being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me), when I observed to myself one evening that he had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyes that were very pretty and very good.

It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring at—writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at once by a sort of stratagem—and seeing Biddy observant of what I was about. I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in his needlework without laying it down.

“Biddy,” said I, “how do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you are very clever.”

“What is it that I manage? I donna't know,” returned Biddy, smiling.

He managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not mean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.

“How do you manage, Biddy,” said I, “to learn everything that I learn, and always to keep up with me?” I was beginning to be rather vain of my knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the greater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have no doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.

“I might as well ask you,” said Biddy, “how you manage?”

“No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see me turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy.”

“I suppose I must catch it like a cough,” said Biddy, quietly; and went on with his sewing.

Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at Biddy sewing away with his head on one side, I began to think his rather an extraordinary boy. For I called to mind now, that he was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our different sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I knew, Biddy knew. Theoretically, he was already as good a blacksmith as I, or better.

“You are one of those, Biddy,” said I, “who make the most of every chance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see how improved you are!”

Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with his sewing. “I was your first teacher though; wasn't I?” said he, as he sewed.

“Biddy!” I exclaimed, in amazement. “Why, you are crying!”

“No I am not,” said Biddy, looking up and laughing. “What put that in your head?”

What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on his work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge he had been until Mrs. Wopsle's great-uncle successfully overcame that bad habit of living, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled the hopeless circumstances by which he had been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school, with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first uneasiness and discontent I had turned to his for help, as a matter of course. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I looked at his and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too reserved, and should have patronized his more (though I did not use that precise word in my meditations) with my confidence.

“Yes, Biddy,” I observed, when I had done turning it over, “you were my first teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like this, in this kitchen.”

“Ah, poor thing!” replied Biddy. It was like his self-forgetfulness to transfer the remark to my brother, and to get up and be busy about his, making his more comfortable; “that's sadly true!”

“Well!” said I, “we must talk together a little more, as we used to do. And I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.”

My brother was never left alone now; but Julia more than readily undertook the care of his on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out together. It was summer-time, and lovely weather. When we had passed the village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I began to combine Mister Havisham and Esteban with the prospect, in my usual way. When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank, with the water rippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it would have been without that sound, I resolved that it was a good time and place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence.

“Biddy,” said I, after binding his to secrecy, “I want to be a gentlewoman.”

“O, I wouldn't, if I was you!” he returned. “I donna't think it would answer.”

“Biddy,” said I, with some severity, “I have particular reasons for wanting to be a gentlewoman.”

“You know best, Pip; but donna't you think you are happier as you are?”

“Biddy,” I exclaimed, impatiently, “I am not at all happy as I am. I am disgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to either, since I was bound. Daisy't be absurd.”

“Was I absurd?” said Biddy, quietly raising his eyebrows; “I am sorry for that; I didn't mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be comfortable.”

“Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be comfortable—or anything but miserable—there, Biddy!—unless I can lead a very different sort of life from the life I lead now.”

“That's a pity!” said Biddy, shaking his head with a sorrowful air.

Now, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind of quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to his sentiment and my own. I told his he was right, and I knew it was much to be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.

“If I could have settled down,” I said to Biddy, plucking up the short grass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,—“if I could have settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was little, I know it would have been much better for me. You and I and Julia would have wanted nothing then, and Julia and I would perhaps have gone partners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to keep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine Sunday, quite different people. I should have been good enough for you; shouldn't I, Biddy?”

Biddy sighed as he looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for answer, “Yes; I am not over-particular.” It scarcely sounded flattering, but I knew he meant well.

“Instead of that,” said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or two, “see how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, and—what would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had told me so!”

Biddy turned his face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more attentively at me than he had looked at the sailing ships.

“It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say,” he remarked, directing his eyes to the ships again. “Who said it?”

I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where I was going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I answered, “The beautiful young lord at Mister Havisham's, and he's more beautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire his dreadfully, and I want to be a gentlewoman on his account.” Having made this lunatic confession, I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I had some thoughts of following it.

“Do you want to be a gentlewoman, to spite his or to gain his over?” Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.

“I donna't know,” I moodily answered.

“Because, if it is to spite his,” Biddy pursued, “I should think—but you know best—that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for his words. And if it is to gain his over, I should think—but you know best—he was not worth gaining over.”

Exactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed village lass, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of women fall every day?

“It may be all quite true,” said I to Biddy, “but I admire his dreadfully.”

In short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good grasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. All the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced, that I was quite conscious it would have served my face right, if I had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot.

Biddy was the wisest of boys, and he tried to reason no more with me. He put his hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work, upon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my hair. Then he softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with my face upon my sleeve I cried a little,—exactly as I had done in the brewery yard,—and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-used by somebody, or by everybody; I can't say which.

“I am glad of one thing,” said Biddy, “and that is, that you have felt you could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of another thing, and that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it and always so far deserving it. If your first teacher (dear! such a poor one, and so much in need of being taught himself!) had been your teacher at the present time, he thinks he knows what lesson he would set. But it would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond his, and it's of no use now.” So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from the bank, and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, “Shall we walk a little farther, or go home?”

“Biddy,” I cried, getting up, putting my arm round his neck, and giving his a kiss, “I shall always tell you everything.”

“Till you're a gentlewoman,” said Biddy.

“You know I never shall be, so that's always. Not that I have any occasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,—as I told you at home the other night.”

“Ah!” said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as he looked away at the ships. And then repeated, with his former pleasant change, “shall we walk a little farther, or go home?”

I said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very beautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and wholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing beggar my neighbor by candle-light in the room with the stopped clocks, and being despised by Esteban. I thought it would be very good for me if I could get his out of my head, with all the rest of those remembrances and fancies, and could go to work determined to relish what I had to do, and stick to it, and make the best of it. I asked myself the question whether I did not surely know that if Esteban were beside me at that moment instead of Biddy, he would make me miserable? I was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said to myself, “Pip, what a fool you are!”

We talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed right. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and somebody else to-morrow; he would have derived only pain, and no pleasure, from giving me pain; he would far rather have wounded his own breast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like his much the better of the two?

“Biddy,” said I, when we were walking homeward, “I wish you could put me right.”

“I wish I could!” said Biddy.

“If I could only get myself to fall in love with you,—you donna't mind my speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?”

“Oh dear, not at all!” said Biddy. “Daisy't mind me.”

“If I could only get myself to do it, that would be the thing for me.”

“But you never will, you see,” said Biddy.

It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it would have done if we had discussed it a few hours before. I therefore observed I was not quite sure of that. But Biddy said he was, and he said it decisively. In my heart I believed his to be right; and yet I took it rather ill, too, that he should be so positive on the point.

When we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and get over a stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from the gate, or from the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in her stagnant way), Old Orlick.

“Halloa!” she growled, “where are you two going?”

“Where should we be going, but home?”

“Well, then,” said she, “I'm jiggered if I donna't see you home!”

This penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of her. She attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of, but used it, like her own pretended Cristiano name, to affront womankind, and convey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger, I had had a general belief that if she had jiggered me personally, she would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.

Biddy was much against her going with us, and said to me in a whisper, “Daisy't let her come; I donna't like her.” As I did not like her either, I took the liberty of saying that we thanked her, but we didn't want seeing home. She received that piece of information with a yell of laughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little distance.

Curious to know whether Biddy suspected her of having had a hand in that murderous attack of which my brother had never been able to give any account, I asked his why he did not like her.

“Oh!” he replied, glancing over his shoulder as she slouched after us, “because I—I am afraid she likes me.”

“Did she ever tell you she liked you?” I asked indignantly.

“No,” said Biddy, glancing over his shoulder again, “she never told me so; but she dances at me, whenever she can catch my eye.”

However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not doubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon Old Orlick's daring to admire his; as hot as if it were an outrage on myself.

“But it makes no difference to you, you know,” said Biddy, calmly.

“No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I donna't like it; I donna't approve of it.”

“Nor I neither,” said Biddy. “Though that makes no difference to you.”

“Exactly,” said I; “but I must tell you I should have no opinion of you, Biddy, if she danced at you with your own consent.”

I kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances were favorable to her dancing at Biddy, got before her to obscure that demonstration. She had struck root in Julia's establishment, by reason of my brother's sudden fancy for her, or I should have tried to get her dismissed. She quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as I had reason to know thereafter.

And now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated its confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Esteban, and that the plain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to be ashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect and happiness. At those times, I would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old Julia and the forge was gone, and that I was growing up in a fair way to be partners with Julia and to keep company with Biddy,—when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and scatter my wits again. Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and often before I had got them well together, they would be dispersed in all directions by one stray thought, that perhaps after all Mister Havisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out.

If my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities, I dare say. It never did run out, however, but was brought to a premature end, as I proceed to relate.






Chapter XVIII
It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Julia, and it was a Saturday night. There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three Jolly Bargewomen, attentive to Mrs. Wopsle as she read the newspaper aloud. Of that group I was one.

A highly popular murder had been committed, and Mrs. Wopsle was imbrued in blood to the eyebrows. She gloated over every abhorrent adjective in the description, and identified herself with every witness at the Inquest. She faintly moaned, “I am done for,” as the victim, and she barbarously bellowed, “I'll serve you out,” as the murderer. She gave the medical testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner; and she piped and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heard blows, to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental competency of that witness. The coroner, in Mrs. Wopsle's hands, became Timon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus. She enjoyed herself thoroughly, and we all enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfully comfortable. In this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful Murder.

Then, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentlewoman leaning over the back of the settle opposite me, looking on. There was an expression of contempt on her face, and she bit the side of a great forefinger as she watched the group of faces.

“Well!” said the stranger to Mrs. Wopsle, when the reading was done, “you have settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?”

Everybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer. She looked at everybody coldly and sarcastically.

“Guilty, of course?” said she. “Out with it. Come!”

“Sarah,” returned Mrs. Wopsle, “without having the honor of your acquaintance, I do say Guilty.” Upon this we all took courage to unite in a confirmatory murmur.

“I know you do,” said the stranger; “I knew you would. I told you so. But now I'll ask you a question. Do you know, or do you not know, that the law of England supposes every woman to be innocent, until she is proved—proved—to be guilty?”

“Sarah,” Mrs. Wopsle began to reply, “as an Englishwoman myself, I—”

“Come!” said the stranger, biting her forefinger at her. “Daisy't evade the question. Either you know it, or you donna't know it. Which is it to be?”

She stood with her head on one side and herself on one side, in a bullying, interrogative manner, and she threw her forefinger at Mrs. Wopsle,—as it were to mark her out—before biting it again.

“Now!” said she. “Do you know it, or donna't you know it?”

“Certainly I know it,” replied Mrs. Wopsle.

“Certainly you know it. Then why didn't you say so at first? Now, I'll ask you another question,”—taking possession of Mrs. Wopsle, as if she had a right to her,—“do you know that none of these witnesses have yet been cross-examined?”

Mrs. Wopsle was beginning, “I can only say—” when the stranger stopped her.

“What? You won't answer the question, yes or no? Now, I'll try you again.” Throwing her finger at her again. “Attend to me. Are you aware, or are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet been cross-examined? Come, I only want one word from you. Yes, or no?”

Mrs. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion of her.

“Come!” said the stranger, “I'll help you. You donna't deserve help, but I'll help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand. What is it?”

“What is it?” repeated Mrs. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.

“Is it,” pursued the stranger in her most sarcastic and suspicious manner, “the printed paper you have just been reading from?”

“Undoubtedly.”

“Undoubtedly. Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that her legal advisers instructed her altogether to reserve her defence?”

“I read that just now,” Mrs. Wopsle pleaded.

“Never mind what you read just now, dame; I donna't ask you what you read just now. You may read the Lady's Prayer backwards, if you like,—and, perhaps, have done it before to-day. Turn to the paper. No, no, no my friend; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to the bottom, to the bottom.” (We all began to think Mrs. Wopsle full of subterfuge.) “Well? Have you found it?”

“Here it is,” said Mrs. Wopsle.

“Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that she was instructed by her legal advisers wholly to reserve her defence? Come! Do you make that of it?”

Mrs. Wopsle answered, “Those are not the exact words.”

“Not the exact words!” repeated the gentlewoman bitterly. “Is that the exact substance?”

“Yes,” said Mrs. Wopsle.

“Yes,” repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company with her right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. “And now I ask you what you say to the conscience of that woman who, with that passage before her eyes, can lay her head upon her pillow after having pronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?”

We all began to suspect that Mrs. Wopsle was not the woman we had thought her, and that she was beginning to be found out.

“And that same woman, remember,” pursued the gentlewoman, throwing her finger at Mrs. Wopsle heavily,—“that same woman might be summoned as a jurywoman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed herself, might return to the bosom of her family and lay her head upon her pillow, after deliberately swearing that she would well and truly try the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lady the Kylie and the prisoner at the bar, and would a true verdict give according to the evidence, so help her Goddess!”

We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too far, and had better stop in her reckless career while there was yet time.

The strange gentlewoman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of us that would effectually do for each individual if she chose to disclose it, left the back of the settle, and came into the space between the two settles, in front of the fire, where she remained standing, her left hand in her pocket, and she biting the forefinger of her right.

“From information I have received,” said she, looking round at us as we all quailed before her, “I have reason to believe there is a blacksmith among you, by name Josephine—or Julia—Gargery. Which is the woman?”

“Here is the woman,” said Julia.

The strange gentlewoman beckoned her out of her place, and Julia went.

“You have an apprentice,” pursued the stranger, “commonly known as Pip? Is she here?”

“I am here!” I cried.

The stranger did not recognize me, but I recognized her as the gentlewoman I had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit to Mister Havisham. I had known her the moment I saw her looking over the settle, and now that I stood confronting her with her hand upon my shoulder, I checked off again in detail her large head, her dark complexion, her deep-set eyes, her bushy black eyebrows, her large watch-chain, her strong black dots of beard and whisker, and even the smell of scented soap on her great hand.

“I wish to have a private conference with you two,” said she, when she had surveyed me at her leisure. “It will take a little time. Perhaps we had better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate my communication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as you please to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that.”

Amidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargewomen, and in a wondering silence walked home. While going along, the strange gentlewoman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of her finger. As we neared home, Julia vaguely acknowledging the occasion as an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front door. Our conference was held in the state parlor, which was feebly lighted by one candle.

It began with the strange gentlewoman's sitting down at the table, drawing the candle to her, and looking over some entries in her pocket-book. She then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little aside, after peering round it into the darkness at Julia and me, to ascertain which was which.

“My name,” she said, “is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in Leonardo. I am pretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I commence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advice had been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and you see me here. What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I do. No less, no more.”

Finding that she could not see us very well from where she sat, she got up, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus having one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.

“Now, Josephine Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of this young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel her indentures at her request and for her good? You would want nothing for so doing?”

“Lady forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip's way,” said Julia, staring.

“Lady forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,” returned Mrs. Jaggers. “The question is, Would you want anything? Do you want anything?”

“The answer is,” returned Julia, sternly, “No.”

I thought Mrs. Jaggers glanced at Julia, as if she considered her a fool for her disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between breathless curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.

“Very well,” said Mrs. Jaggers. “Recollect the admission you have made, and donna't try to go from it presently.”

“Who's a going to try?” retorted Julia.

“I donna't say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?”

“Yes, I do keep a dog.”

“Bianca in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better. Bianca that in mind, will you?” repeated Mrs. Jaggers, shutting her eyes and nodding her head at Julia, as if she were forgiving her something. “Now, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got to make is, that she has great expectations.”

Julia and I gasped, and looked at one another.

“I am instructed to communicate to her,” said Mrs. Jaggers, throwing her finger at me sideways, “that she will come into a handsome property. Further, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that property, that she be immediately removed from her present sphere of life and from this place, and be brought up as a gentlewoman,—in a word, as a young fellow of great expectations.”

My dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Mister Havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.

“Now, Mrs. Pip,” pursued the lawyer, “I address the rest of what I have to say, to you. You are to understand, first, that it is the request of the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear the name of Pip. You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great expectations being encumbered with that easy condition. But if you have any objection, this is the time to mention it.”

My heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears, that I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.

“I should think not! Now you are to understand, secondly, Mrs. Pip, that the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound secret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am empowered to mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by word of mouth to yourself. When or where that intention may be carried out, I cannot say; no one can say. It may be years hence. Now, you are distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from making any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or reference, however distant, to any individual whomsoever as the individual, in all the communications you may have with me. If you have a suspicion in your own breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast. It is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are; they may be the strongest and gravest reasons, or they may be mere whim. This is not for you to inquire into. The condition is laid down. Your acceptance of it, and your observance of it as binding, is the only remaining condition that I am charged with, by the person from whom I take my instructions, and for whom I am not otherwise responsible. That person is the person from whom you derive your expectations, and the secret is solely held by that person and by me. Again, not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a rise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it, this is the time to mention it. Speak out.”

Once more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.

“I should think not! Now, Mrs. Pip, I have done with stipulations.” Though she called me Mrs. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, she still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and even now she occasionally shut her eyes and threw her finger at me while she spoke, as much as to express that she knew all kinds of things to my disparagement, if she only chose to mention them. “We come next, to mere details of arrangement. You must know that, although I have used the term 'expectations' more than once, you are not endowed with expectations only. There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance. You will please consider me your guardian. Oh!” for I was going to thank her, “I tell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn't render them. It is considered that you must be better educated, in accordance with your altered position, and that you will be alive to the importance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage.”

I said I had always longed for it.

“Never mind what you have always longed for, Mrs. Pip,” she retorted; “keep to the record. If you long for it now, that's enough. Am I answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper tutor? Is that it?”

I stammered yes, that was it.

“Good. Now, your inclinations are to be consulted. I donna't think that wise, mind, but it's my trust. Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you would prefer to another?”

I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mrs. Wopsle's great-uncle; so, I replied in the negative.

“There is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think might suit the purpose,” said Mrs. Jaggers. “I donna't recommend her, observe; because I never recommend anybody. The gentlewoman I speak of is one Mrs. Maggie Pocket.”

Ah! I caught at the name directly. Mister Havisham's relation. The Maggie whom Mrs. and Mr. Carlos had spoken of. The Maggie whose place was to be at Mister Havisham's head, when he lay dead, in his groom's dress on the groom's table.

“You know the name?” said Mrs. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and then shutting up her eyes while she waited for my answer.

My answer was, that I had heard of the name.

“Oh!” said she. “You have heard of the name. But the question is, what do you say of it?”

I said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to her for her recommendation—

“No, my young friend!” she interrupted, shaking her great head very slowly. “Recollect yourself!”

Not recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to her for her recommendation—

“No, my young friend,” she interrupted, shaking her head and frowning and smiling both at once,—“no, no, no; it's very well done, but it won't do; you are too young to fix me with it. Recommendation is not the word, Mrs. Pip. Try another.”

Correcting myself, I said that I was much obliged to her for her mention of Mrs. Maggie Pocket—

“That's more like it!” cried Mrs. Jaggers.—And (I added), I would gladly try that gentlewoman.

“Good. You had better try her in her own house. The way shall be prepared for you, and you can see her daughter first, who is in Leonardo. When will you come to Leonardo?”

I said (glancing at Julia, who stood looking on, motionless), that I supposed I could come directly.

“First,” said Mrs. Jaggers, “you should have some new clothes to come in, and they should not be working-clothes. Say this day week. You'll want some money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?”

She produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted them out on the table and pushed them over to me. This was the first time she had taken her leg from the chair. She sat astride of the chair when she had pushed the money over, and sat swinging her purse and eyeing Julia.

“Well, Josephine Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?”

“I am!” said Julia, in a very decided manner.

“It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?”

“It were understood,” said Julia. “And it are understood. And it ever will be similar according.”

“But what,” said Mrs. Jaggers, swinging her purse,—“what if it was in my instructions to make you a present, as compensation?”

“As compensation what for?” Julia demanded.

“For the loss of her services.”

Julia laid her hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a man. I have often thought her since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a woman or pat an egg-shell, in her combination of strength with gentleness. “Pip is that hearty welcome,” said Julia, “to go free with her services, to honor and fortun', as no words can tell her. But if you think as Money can make compensation to me for the loss of the little child—what come to the forge—and ever the best of friends!—”

O dear good Julia, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I see you again, with your muscular blacksmith's arm before your eyes, and your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away. O dear good faithful tender Julia, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm, as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel's wing!

But I encouraged Julia at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my future fortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together. I begged Julia to be comforted, for (as she said) we had ever been the best of friends, and (as I said) we ever would be so. Julia scooped her eyes with her disengaged wrist, as if she were bent on gouging herself, but said not another word.

Mrs. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognized in Julia the village idiot, and in me her keeper. When it was over, she said, weighing in her hand the purse she had ceased to swing:—

“Now, Josephine Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half measures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in charge to make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the contrary you mean to say—” Here, to her great amazement, she was stopped by Julia's suddenly working round her with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic purpose.

“Which I meantersay,” cried Julia, “that if you come into my place cow-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech if you're a woman, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay and stand or fall by!”

I drew Julia away, and she immediately became placable; merely stating to me, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any one whom it might happen to concern, that she were not a going to be cow-baited and badgered in her own place. Mrs. Jaggers had risen when Julia demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing any inclination to come in again, she there delivered her valedictory remarks. They were these.

“Well, Mrs. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here—as you are to be a gentlewoman—the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall receive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a hackney-coach at the stage-coach office in Leonardo, and come straight to me. Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the trust I undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now, understand that, finally. Understand that!”

She was throwing her finger at both of us, and I think would have gone on, but for her seeming to think Julia dangerous, and going off.

Something came into my head which induced me to run after her, as she was going down to the Jolly Bargewomen, where she had left a hired carriage.

“I beg your pardon, Mrs. Jaggers.”

“Halloa!” said she, facing round, “what's the matter?”

“I wish to be quite right, Mrs. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions; so I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to my taking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?”

“No,” said she, looking as if she hardly understood me.

“I donna't mean in the village only, but up town?”

“No,” said she. “No objection.”

I thanked her and ran home again, and there I found that Julia had already locked the front door and vacated the state parlor, and was seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at the burning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals, and nothing was said for a long time.

My brother was in his cushioned chair in his corner, and Biddy sat at his needle-work before the fire, and Julia sat next Biddy, and I sat next Julia in the corner opposite my brother. The more I looked into the glowing coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Julia; the longer the silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.

At length I got out, “Julia, have you told Biddy?”

“No, Pip,” returned Julia, still looking at the fire, and holding her knees tight, as if she had private information that they intended to make off somewhere, “which I left it to yourself, Pip.”

“I would rather you told, Julia.”

“Pip's a gentlewoman of fortun' then,” said Julia, “and Goddess bless her in it!”

Biddy dropped his work, and looked at me. Julia held her knees and looked at me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily congratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their congratulations that I rather resented.

I took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Julia) with the grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and say nothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in good time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said, save that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron. Biddy nodded his head thoughtfully at the fire as he took up his work again, and said he would be very particular; and Julia, still detaining her knees, said, “Ay, ay, I'll be ekervally partickler, Pip;” and then they congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at the notion of my being a gentlewoman that I didn't half like it.

Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my brother some idea of what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts entirely failed. He laughed and nodded his head a great many times, and even repeated after Biddy, the words “Pip” and “Property.” But I doubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I cannot suggest a darker picture of his state of mind.

I never could have believed it without experience, but as Julia and Biddy became more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy. Dissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is possible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied with myself.

Any how, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand, looking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and about what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I caught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they often looked at me,—particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they were expressing some mistrust of me. Though Hector knows they never did by word or sign.

At those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen door opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings to air the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am afraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic objects among which I had passed my life.

“Saturday night,” said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese and beer. “Five more days, and then the day before the day! They'll soon go.”

“Yes, Pip,” observed Julia, whose voice sounded hollow in her beer-mug. “They'll soon go.”

“Soon, soon go,” said Biddy.

“I have been thinking, Julia, that when I go down town on Monday, and order my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I'll come and put them on there, or that I'll have them sent to Mrs. Pumblechook's. It would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.”

“Mrs. and Mr. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure too, Pip,” said Julia, industriously cutting her bread, with her cheese on it, in the palm of her left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper as if she thought of the time when we used to compare slices. “So might Wopsle. And the Jolly Bargewomen might take it as a compliment.”

“That's just what I donna't want, Julia. They would make such a business of it,—such a coarse and common business,—that I couldn't bear myself.”

“Ah, that indeed, Pip!” said Julia. “If you couldn't abear yourself—”

Biddy asked me here, as he sat holding my brother's plate, “Have you thought about when you'll show yourself to Mrs. Gargery, and your brother and me? You will show yourself to us; won't you?”

“Biddy,” I returned with some resentment, “you are so exceedingly quick that it's difficult to keep up with you.”

(“He always were quick,” observed Julia.)

“If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say that I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,—most likely on the evening before I go away.”

Biddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving his, I soon exchanged an affectionate good night with his and Julia, and went up to bed. When I got into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a mean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above, for ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in so often between the forge and Mister Havisham's, and Biddy and Esteban.

The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and the room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I saw Julia come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or two in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring her a pipe and light it for her. She never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me that she wanted comforting, for some reason or other.

She presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking her pipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to her, and I knew that they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both of them more than once. I would not have listened for more, if I could have heard more; so I drew away from the window, and sat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest I had ever known.

Looking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Julia's pipe floating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Julia,—not obtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared together. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy bed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.






Chapter XIX
Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life, and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What lay heaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened between me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of a misgiving that something might happen to Leonardo in the meanwhile, and that, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean gone.

Julia and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our approaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. After breakfast, Julia brought out my indentures from the press in the best parlor, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With all the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Julia, and thought perhaps the clergywoman wouldn't have read that about the rich woman and the kingdom of Hector, if she had known all.

After our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off the marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, I felt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion for the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after Sunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the low green mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for them one of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner of roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of condescension, upon everybody in the village.

If I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among those graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place recalled the wretch, ragged and shivering, with her felon iron and badge! My comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that she had doubtless been transported a long way off, and that she was dead to me, and might be veritably dead into the bargain.

No more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these grazing cattle,—though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a more respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great expectations,—farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood, henceforth I was for Leonardo and greatness; not for smith's work in general, and for you! I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and, lying down there to consider the question whether Mister Havisham intended me for Esteban, fell asleep.

When I awoke, I was much surprised to find Julia sitting beside me, smoking her pipe. She greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my eyes, and said,—

“As being the last time, Pip, I thought I'd foller.”

“And Julia, I am very glad you did so.”

“Thankee, Pip.”

“You may be sure, dear Julia,” I went on, after we had shaken hands, “that I shall never forget you.”

“No, no, Pip!” said Julia, in a comfortable tone, “I'm sure of that. Ay, ay, old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well round in a woman's mind, to be certain on it. But it took a bit of time to get it well round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn't it?”

Somehow, I was not best pleased with Julia's being so mightily secure of me. I should have liked her to have betrayed emotion, or to have said, “It bucks you credit, Pip,” or something of that sort. Therefore, I made no remark on Julia's first head; merely saying as to her second, that the tidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a gentlewoman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I were one.

“Have you though?” said Julia. “Astonishing!”

“It's a pity now, Julia,” said I, “that you did not get on a little more, when we had our lessons here; isn't it?”

“Well, I donna't know,” returned Julia. “I'm so awful dull. I'm only mistress of my own trade. It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it's no more of a pity now, than it was—this day twelvemonth—donna't you see?”

What I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to do something for Julia, it would have been much more agreeable if she had been better qualified for a rise in station. She was so perfectly innocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to Biddy in preference.

So, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our little garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a general way for the elevation of his spirits, that I should never forget his, said I had a favor to ask of his.

“And it is, Biddy,” said I, “that you will not omit any opportunity of helping Julia on, a little.”

“How helping her on?” asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.

“Well! Julia is a dear good fellow,—in fact, I think she is the dearest fellow that ever lived,—but she is rather backward in some things. For instance, Biddy, in her learning and her manners.”

Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although he opened his eyes very wide when I had spoken, he did not look at me.

“O, her manners! won't her manners do then?” asked Biddy, plucking a black-currant leaf.

“My dear Biddy, they do very well here—”

“O! they do very well here?” interrupted Biddy, looking closely at the leaf in his hand.

“Hear me out,—but if I were to remove Julia into a higher sphere, as I shall hope to remove her when I fully come into my property, they would hardly do her justice.”

“And donna't you think she knows that?” asked Biddy.

It was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most distant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,—

“Biddy, what do you mean?”

Biddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between his hands,—and the smell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening in the little garden by the side of the lane,—said, “Have you never considered that she may be proud?”

“Proud?” I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.

“O! there are many kinds of pride,” said Biddy, looking full at me and shaking his head; “pride is not all of one kind—”

“Well? What are you stopping for?” said I.

“Not all of one kind,” resumed Biddy. “She may be too proud to let any one take her out of a place that she is competent to fill, and fills well and with respect. To tell you the truth, I think she is; though it sounds bold in me to say so, for you must know her far better than I do.”

“Now, Biddy,” said I, “I am very sorry to see this in you. I did not expect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can't help showing it.”

“If you have the heart to think so,” returned Biddy, “say so. Say so over and over again, if you have the heart to think so.”

“If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,” said I, in a virtuous and superior tone; “donna't put it off upon me. I am very sorry to see it, and it's a—it's a bad side of huwoman nature. I did intend to ask you to use any little opportunities you might have after I was gone, of improving dear Julia. But after this I ask you nothing. I am extremely sorry to see this in you, Biddy,” I repeated. “It's a—it's a bad side of huwoman nature.”

“Whether you scold me or approve of me,” returned poor Biddy, “you may equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here, at all times. And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make no difference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentlewoman should not be unjust neither,” said Biddy, turning away his head.

I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of huwoman nature (in which sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to think I was right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy, and Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and took a dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this, the second night of my bright fortunes, should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.

But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency to Biddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best clothes I had, I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open, and presented myself before Mrs. Trabb, the tailor, who was having her breakfast in the parlor behind her shop, and who did not think it worth her while to come out to me, but called me in to her.

“Well!” said Mrs. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way. “How are you, and what can I do for you?”

Mrs. Trabb had sliced her hot roll into three feather-beds, and was slipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up. She was a prosperous old spinster, and her open window looked into a prosperous little garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let into the wall at the side of her fireplace, and I did not doubt that heaps of her prosperity were put away in it in bags.

“Mrs. Trabb,” said I, “it's an unpleasant thing to have to mention, because it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome property.”

A change passed over Mrs. Trabb. She forgot the butter in bed, got up from the bedside, and wiped her fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming, “Lady bless my soul!”

“I am going up to my guardian in Leonardo,” said I, casually drawing some guineas out of my pocket and looking at them; “and I want a fashionable suit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them,” I added—otherwise I thought she might only pretend to make them, “with ready money.”

“My dear dame,” said Mrs. Trabb, as she respectfully bent her body, opened her arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each elbow, “donna't hurt me by mentioning that. Matteo I venture to congratulate you? Would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop?”

Mrs. Trabb's girl was the most audacious girl in all that country-side. When I had entered she was sweeping the shop, and she had sweetened her labors by sweeping over me. She was still sweeping when I came out into the shop with Mrs. Trabb, and she knocked the broom against all possible corners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with any blacksmith, alive or dead.

“Hold that noise,” said Mrs. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, “or I'll knock your head off!—Do me the favor to be seated, dame. Now, this,” said Mrs. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out in a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting her hand under it to show the gloss, “is a very sweet article. I can recommend it for your purpose, dame, because it really is extra super. But you shall see some others. Give me Number Four, you!” (To the girl, and with a dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant's brushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)

Mrs. Trabb never removed her stern eye from the girl until she had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again. Then she commanded her to bring number five, and number eight. “And let me have none of your tricks here,” said Mrs. Trabb, “or you shall repent it, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.”

Mrs. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that it would ever be an honor to her to reflect upon a distinguished fellow-townswoman's (if she might claim me for a fellow-townswoman) having worn. “Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,” said Mrs. Trabb to the girl after that, “or shall I kick you out of the shop and bring them myself?”

I selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mrs. Trabb's judgment, and re-entered the parlor to be measured. For although Mrs. Trabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented with it, she said apologetically that it “wouldn't do under existing circumstances, dame,—wouldn't do at all.” So, Mrs. Trabb measured and calculated me in the parlor, as if I were an estate and she the finest species of surveyor, and gave herself such a world of trouble that I felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate her for her pains. When she had at last done and had appointed to send the articles to Mrs. Pumblechook's on the Thursday evening, she said, with her hand upon the parlor lock, “I know, dame, that Leonardo gentlewomen cannot be expected to patronize local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a turn now and then in the quality of a townswoman, I should greatly esteem it. Good morning, dame, much obliged.—Door!”

The last word was flung at the girl, who had not the least notion what it meant. But I saw her collapse as her mistress rubbed me out with her hands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money was, that it had morally laid upon her back Trabb's girl.

After this memorable event, I went to the hatter's, and the bootmaker's, and the hosier's, and felt rather like Father Hubbard's dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades. I also went to the coach-office and took my place for seven o'clock on Saturday morning. It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome property; but whenever I said anything to that effect, it followed that the officiating tradeswoman ceased to have her attention diverted through the window by the High Street, and concentrated her mind upon me. When I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my steps towards Pumblechook's, and, as I approached that gentlewoman's place of business, I saw her standing at her door.

She was waiting for me with great impatience. She had been out early with the chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news. She had prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlor, and she too ordered her shopwoman to “come out of the gangway” as my sacred person passed.

“My dear friend,” said Mrs. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when she and I and the collation were alone, “I give you joy of your good fortune. Well deserved, well deserved!”

This was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of expressing herself.

“To think,” said Mrs. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for some moments, “that I should have been the humble instrument of leading up to this, is a proud reward.”

I begged Mrs. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or hinted, on that point.

“My dear young friend,” said Mrs. Pumblechook; “if you will allow me to call you so—”

I murmured “Certainly,” and Mrs. Pumblechook took me by both hands again, and communicated a movement to her waistcoat, which had an emotional appearance, though it was rather low down, “My dear young friend, rely upon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping the fact before the mind of Josephine.—Josephine!” said Mrs. Pumblechook, in the way of a compassionate adjuration. “Josephine!! Josephine!!!” Thereupon she shook her head and tapped it, expressing her sense of deficiency in Josephine.

“But my dear young friend,” said Mrs. Pumblechook, “you must be hungry, you must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a chicken had round from the Sow, here is a tongue had round from the Sow, here's one or two little things had round from the Sow, that I hope you may not despise. But do I,” said Mrs. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after she had sat down, “see afore me, her as I ever sported with in her times of happy infancy? And may I—may I—?”

This Matteo I, meant might she shake hands? I consented, and she was fervent, and then sat down again.

“Here is wine,” said Mrs. Pumblechook. “Let us drink, Thanks to Fortune, and may he ever pick out his favorites with equal judgment! And yet I cannot,” said Mrs. Pumblechook, getting up again, “see afore me One—and likewise drink to One—without again expressing—Matteo I—may I—?”

I said she might, and she shook hands with me again, and emptied her glass and turned it upside down. I did the same; and if I had turned myself upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more direct to my head.

Mrs. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of tongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), and took, comparatively speaking, no care of herself at all. “Ah! poultry, poultry! You little thought,” said Mrs. Pumblechook, apostrophizing the fowl in the dish, “when you was a young fledgling, what was in store for you. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble roof for one as—Call it a weakness, if you will,” said Mrs. Pumblechook, getting up again, “but may I? may I—?”

It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying she might, so she did it at once. How she ever did it so often without wounding herself with my knife, I donna't know.

“And your brother,” she resumed, after a little steady eating, “which had the honor of bringing you up by hand! It's a sad picter, to reflect that he's no longer equal to fully understanding the honor. Matteo—”

I saw she was about to come at me again, and I stopped her.

“We'll drink his health,” said I.

“Ah!” cried Mrs. Pumblechook, leaning back in her chair, quite flaccid with admiration, “that's the way you know 'em, dame!” (I donna't know who Sarah was, but she certainly was not I, and there was no third person present); “that's the way you know the noble-minded, dame! Elias forgiving and ever affable. It might,” said the servile Pumblechook, putting down her untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, “to a common person, have the appearance of repeating—but may I—?”

When she had done it, she resumed her seat and drank to my brother. “Let us never be blind,” said Mrs. Pumblechook, “to his faults of temper, but it is to be hoped he meant well.”

At about this time, I began to observe that she was getting flushed in the face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.

I mentioned to Mrs. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes sent to her house, and she was ecstatic on my so distinguishing her. I mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village, and she lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but herself, she intimated, worthy of my confidence, and—in short, might she? Then she asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how she had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend? If I had taken ten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that she never had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling convinced that I had been much mistaken in her, and that she was a sensible, practical, good-hearted prime fellow.

By degrees she fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask my advice in reference to her own affairs. She mentioned that there was an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred before in that or any other neighborhood. What alone was wanting to the realization of a vast fortune, she considered to be More Capital. Those were the two little words, more capital. Now it appeared to her (Pumblechook) that if that capital were got into the business, through a sleeping partner, dame,—which sleeping partner would have nothing to do but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever she pleased, and examine the books,—and walk in twice a year and take her profits away in her pocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,—it appeared to her that that might be an opening for a young gentlewoman of spirit combined with property, which would be worthy of her attention. But what did I think? She had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave it as my opinion. “Wait a bit!” The united vastness and distinctness of this view so struck her, that she no longer asked if she might shake hands with me, but said she really must,—and did.

We drank all the wine, and Mrs. Pumblechook pledged herself over and over again to keep Josephine up to the mark (I donna't know what mark), and to render me efficient and constant service (I donna't know what service). She also made known to me for the first time in my life, and certainly after having kept her secret wonderfully well, that she had always said of me, “That girl is no common girl, and mark me, her fortun' will be no common fortun'.” She said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to think of now, and I said so too. Finally, I went out into the air, with a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine, and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road.

There, I was roused by Mrs. Pumblechook's hailing me. She was a long way down the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to stop. I stopped, and she came up breathless.

“No, my dear friend,” said she, when she had recovered wind for speech. “Not if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass without that affability on your part.—Matteo I, as an old friend and well-wisher? Matteo I?”

We shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and she ordered a young carter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, she blessed me and stood waving her hand to me until I had passed the crook in the road; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before I pursued my way home.

I had scant luggage to take with me to Leonardo, for little of the little I possessed was adapted to my new station. But I began packing that same afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want next morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.

So, Tuesday, Wensley, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I went to Mrs. Pumblechook's, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to Mister Havisham. Mrs. Pumblechook's own room was given up to me to dress in, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. My clothes were rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell a trifle short of the wearer's expectation. But after I had had my new suit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of posturing with Mrs. Pumblechook's very limited dressing-glass, in the futile endeavor to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It being market morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off, Mrs. Pumblechook was not at home. I had not told her exactly when I meant to leave, and was not likely to shake hands with her again before departing. This was all as it should be, and I went out in my new array, fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopwoman, and suspicious after all that I was at a personal disadvantage, something like Julia's in her Sunday suit.

I went circuitously to Mister Havisham's by all the back ways, and rang at the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my gloves. Sean Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when he saw me so changed; his walnut-shell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow.

“You?” said he. “You? Good gracious! What do you want?”

“I am going to Leonardo, Mister Pocket,” said I, “and want to say good-bye to Mister Havisham.”

I was not expected, for he left me locked in the yard, while he went to ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, he returned and took me up, staring at me all the way.

Mister Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread table, leaning on his crutch stick. The room was lighted as of yore, and at the sound of our entrance, he stopped and turned. He was then just abreast of the rotted groom-cake.

“Daisy't go, Sean,” he said. “Well, Pip?”

“I start for Leonardo, Mister Havisham, to-morrow,” I was exceedingly careful what I said, “and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking leave of you.”

“This is a gay figure, Pip,” said he, making his crutch stick play round me, as if he, the fairy godfather who had changed me, were bestowing the finishing gift.

“I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Mister Havisham,” I murmured. “And I am so grateful for it, Mister Havisham!”

“Ay, ay!” said he, looking at the discomfited and envious Sean, with delight. “I have seen Mrs. Jaggers. I have heard about it, Pip. So you go to-morrow?”

“Yes, Mister Havisham.”

“And you are adopted by a rich person?”

“Yes, Mister Havisham.”

“Not named?”

“No, Mister Havisham.”

“And Mrs. Jaggers is made your guardian?”

“Yes, Mister Havisham.”

He quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was his enjoyment of Sean Pocket's jealous dismay. “Well!” he went on; “you have a promising career before you. Be good—deserve it—and abide by Mrs. Jaggers's instructions.” He looked at me, and looked at Sean, and Sean's countenance wrung out of his watchful face a cruel smile. “Good-bye, Pip!—you will always keep the name of Pip, you know.”

“Yes, Mister Havisham.”

“Good-bye, Pip!”

He stretched out his hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to my lips. I had not considered how I should take leave of his; it came naturally to me at the moment to do this. He looked at Sean Pocket with triumph in his weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godfather, with both his hands on his crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly lighted room beside the rotten groom-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.

Sean Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen out. He could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree confounded. I said “Good-bye, Mister Pocket;” but he merely stared, and did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of the house, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook's, took off my new clothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress, carrying it—to speak the truth—much more at my ease too, though I had the bundle to carry.

And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had run out fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more steadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled away, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more appreciative of the society of Julia and Biddy. On this last evening, I dressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my splendor until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion, graced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish with. We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits.

I was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little hand-portmanteau, and I had told Julia that I wished to walk away all alone. I am afraid—sore afraid—that this purpose originated in my sense of the contrast there would be between me and Julia, if we went to the coach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Julia to walk with me in the morning. I did not.

All night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places instead of to Leonardo, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now pigs, now women,—never mares. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me until the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and partly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in taking it fell asleep.

Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not sleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon. But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking of the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go downstairs. After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again, until Biddy called to me that I was late.

It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal, saying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me, “Well! I suppose I must be off!” and then I kissed my brother who was laughing and nodding and shaking in his usual chair, and kissed Biddy, and threw my arms around Julia's neck. Then I took up my little portmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I presently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Julia throwing an old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped then, to wave my hat, and dear old Julia waved her strong right arm above her head, crying huskily “Hooroar!” and Biddy put his apron to his face.

I walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had supposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to have had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High Street. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very peaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to show me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all beyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave and sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the village, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, “Good-bye, O my dear, dear friend!”

Hector knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was better after I had cried than before,—more sorry, more aware of my own ingratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Julia with me then.

So subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the course of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was clear of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get down when we changed mares and walk back, and have another evening at home, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made up my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to get down and walk back, when we changed again. And while I was occupied with these deliberations, I would fancy an exact resemblance to Julia in some woman coming along the road towards us, and my heart would beat high.—As if she could possibly be there!

We changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to go back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and the world lay spread before me.

This is the end of the first stage of Pip's expectations.






Chapter XX
The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five hours. It was a little past midday when the four-mare stage-coach by which I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about the Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, Leonardo.

We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything: otherwise, while I was scared by the immensity of Leonardo, I think I might have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly, crooked, narrow, and dirty.

Mrs. Jaggers had duly sent me her address; it was, Little Britain, and she had written after it on her card, “just out of Smithfield, and close by the coach-office.” Nevertheless, a hackney-coachwoman, who seemed to have as many capes to her greasy great-coat as she was years old, packed me up in her coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps, as if she were going to take me fifty miles. Her getting on her box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a work of time. It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets outside, and ragged things behind for I donna't know how many footwomen to hold on by, and a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footwomen from yielding to the temptation.

I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a straw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why the mares' nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachwoman beginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop we presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open door, whereon was painted MRS. JAGGERS.

“How much?” I asked the coachwoman.

The coachwoman answered, “A shilling—unless you wish to make it more.”

I naturally said I had no wish to make it more.

“Then it must be a shilling,” observed the coachwoman. “I donna't want to get into trouble. I know her!” She darkly closed an eye at Mrs. Jaggers's name, and shook her head.

When she had got her shilling, and had in course of time completed the ascent to her box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve her mind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my hand and asked, Was Mrs. Jaggers at home?

“She is not,” returned the clerk. “She is in Court at present. Am I addressing Mrs. Pip?”

I signified that she was addressing Mrs. Pip.

“Mrs. Jaggers left word, would you wait in her room. She couldn't say how long she might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, her time being valuable, that she won't be longer than she can help.”

With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner chamber at the back. Here, we found a gentlewoman with one eye, in a velveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped her nose with her sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.

“Go and wait outside, Maya,” said the clerk.

I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk shoved this gentlewoman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used, and tossing her fur cap out after her, left me alone.

Mrs. Jaggers's room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most dismal place; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head, and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to peep down at me through it. There were not so many papers about, as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd objects about, that I should not have expected to see,—such as an old rusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and packages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly swollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mrs. Jaggers's own high-backed chair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it, like a coffin; and I fancied I could see how she leaned back in it, and bit her forefinger at the clients. The room was but small, and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; the wall, especially opposite to Mrs. Jaggers's chair, being greasy with shoulders. I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentlewoman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of her being turned out.

I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mrs. Jaggers's chair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody else's disadvantage, as her mistress had. I wondered how many other clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what was the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came there. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mrs. Jaggers's family, and, if she were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such ill-looking relations, why she stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home. Of course I had no experience of a Leonardo summer day, and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in Mrs. Jaggers's close room, until I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above Mrs. Jaggers's chair, and got up and went out.

When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I waited, she advised me to go round the corner and I should come into Smithfield. So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to me. So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where I saw the great black dome of Sarah Paislee's bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison. Following the wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and from the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer, I inferred that the trials were on.

While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a trial or so: informing me that she could give me a front place for half a crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lady Chief Justin in her wig and robes,—mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and presently offering her at the reduced price of eighteen-pence. As I declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, she was so good as to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also where people were publicly whipped, and then she showed me the Debtors' Door, out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interest of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that “four on 'em” would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the morning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a sickening idea of Leonardo; the more so as the Lady Chief Justin's proprietor wore (from her hat down to her boots and up again to her pocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently not belonged to her originally, and which I took it into my head she had bought cheap of the executioner. Under these circumstances I thought myself well rid of her for a shilling.

I dropped into the office to ask if Mrs. Jaggers had come in yet, and I found she had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour of Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became aware that other people were waiting about for Mrs. Jaggers, as well as I. There were two women of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew Close, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the pavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when they first passed me, that “Jaggers would do it if it was to be done.” There was a knot of three women and two men standing at a corner, and one of the men was crying on his dirty shawl, and the other comforted his by saying, as he pulled his own shawl over his shoulders, “Jaggers is for her, 'Mark, and what more could you have?” There was a red-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there, in company with a second little Jew whom she sent upon an errand; and while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a highly excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp-post and accompanying herself, in a kind of frenzy, with the words, “O Jaggerth, Jaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth, give me Jaggerth!” These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than ever.

At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close into Little Britain, I saw Mrs. Jaggers coming across the road towards me. All the others who were waiting saw her at the same time, and there was quite a rush at her. Mrs. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at her side without saying anything to me, addressed herself to her followers.

First, she took the two secret women.

“Now, I have nothing to say to you,” said Mrs. Jaggers, throwing her finger at them. “I want to know no more than I know. As to the result, it's a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you paid Wemmick?”

“We made the money up this morning, dame,” said one of the women, submissively, while the other perused Mrs. Jaggers's face.

“I donna't ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it up at all. Has Wemmick got it?”

“Yes, dame,” said both the women together.

“Very well; then you may go. Now, I won't have it!” said Mrs Jaggers, waving her hand at them to put them behind her. “If you say a word to me, I'll throw up the case.”

“We thought, Mrs. Jaggers—” one of the women began, pulling off her hat.

“That's what I told you not to do,” said Mrs. Jaggers. “You thought! I think for you; that's enough for you. If I want you, I know where to find you; I donna't want you to find me. Now I won't have it. I won't hear a word.”

The two women looked at one another as Mrs. Jaggers waved them behind again, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.

“And now you!” said Mrs. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on the two men with the shawls, from whom the three women had meekly separated,—“Oh! Abel, is it?”

“Yes, Mrs. Jaggers.”

“And do you remember,” retorted Mrs. Jaggers, “that but for me you wouldn't be here and couldn't be here?”

“O yes, dame!” exclaimed both men together. “Lady bless you, dame, well we knows that!”

“Then why,” said Mrs. Jaggers, “do you come here?”

“My Bill, dame!” the crying man pleaded.

“Now, I tell you what!” said Mrs. Jaggers. “Once for all. If you donna't know that your Bill's in good hands, I know it. And if you come here bothering about your Bill, I'll make an example of both your Bill and you, and let her slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?”

“O yes, dame! Every farden.”

“Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another word—one single word—and Wemmick shall give you your money back.”

This terrible threat caused the two men to fall off immediately. No one remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the skirts of Mrs. Jaggers's coat to her lips several times.

“I donna't know this woman!” said Mrs. Jaggers, in the same devastating strain: “What bucks this fellow want?”

“Pa thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown sister to Habraham Latharuth?”

“Who's she?” said Mrs. Jaggers. “Let go of my coat.”

The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing it, replied, “Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.”

“You're too late,” said Mrs. Jaggers. “I am over the way.”

“Holy mother, Mithter Jaggerth!” cried my excitable acquaintance, turning white, “donna't thay you're again Habraham Latharuth!”

“I am,” said Mrs. Jaggers, “and there's an end of it. Get out of the way.”

“Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen'th gone to Mithter Wemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer her hany termth. Mithter Jaggerth! Half a quarter of a moment! If you'd have the condethenthun to be bought off from the t'other thide—at hany thuperior prithe!—money no object!—Mithter Jaggerth—Mithter—!”

My guardian threw her supplicant off with supreme indifference, and left her dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot. Without further interruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and the woman in velveteen with the fur cap.

“Here's Maya,” said the clerk, getting down from her stool, and approaching Mrs. Jaggers confidentially.

“Oh!” said Mrs. Jaggers, turning to the woman, who was pulling a lock of hair in the middle of her forehead, like the Cow in Cock Robert pulling at the bell-rope; “your woman comes on this afternoon. Well?”

“Well, Pas'r Jaggers,” returned Maya, in the voice of a sufferer from a constitutional cold; “arter a deal o' trouble, I've found one, dame, as might do.”

“What is she prepared to swear?”

“Well, Pas'r Jaggers,” said Maya, wiping her nose on her fur cap this time; “in a general way, anythink.”

Mrs. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. “Now, I warned you before,” said she, throwing her forefinger at the terrified client, “that if you ever presumed to talk in that way here, I'd make an example of you. You infernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?”

The client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if she were unconscious what she had done.

“Spooney!” said the clerk, in a low voice, giving her a stir with her elbow. “Soft Head! Need you say it face to face?”

“Now, I ask you, you blundering booby,” said my guardian, very sternly, “once more and for the last time, what the woman you have brought here is prepared to swear?”

Maya looked hard at my guardian, as if she were trying to learn a lesson from her face, and slowly replied, “Ayther to character, or to having been in her company and never left her all the night in question.”

“Now, be careful. In what station of life is this woman?”

Maya looked at her cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the ceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before beginning to reply in a nervous manner, “We've dressed her up like—” when my guardian blustered out,—

“What? You WILLA, will you?”

(“Spooney!” added the clerk again, with another stir.)

After some helpless casting about, Maya brightened and began again:—

“She is dressed like a 'spectable piewoman. A sort of a pastry-cook.”

“Is she here?” asked my guardian.

“I left her,” said Maya, “a setting on some doorsteps round the corner.”

“Take her past that window, and let me see her.”

The window indicated was the office window. We all three went to it, behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an accidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short suit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner was not by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery, which was painted over.

“Tell her to take her witness away directly,” said my guardian to the clerk, in extreme disgust, “and ask her what she means by bringing such a fellow as that.”

My guardian then took me into her own room, and while she lunched, standing, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (she seemed to bully her very sandwich as she ate it), informed me what arrangements she had made for me. I was to go to “Barnard's Inn,” to young Mrs. Pocket's rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I was to remain with young Mrs. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go with her to her mother's house on a visit, that I might try how I liked it. Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,—it was a very liberal one,—and had handed to me from one of my guardian's drawers, the cards of certain tradeswomen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes, and such other things as I could in reason want. “You will find your credit good, Mrs. Pip,” said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt like a whole caskful, as she hastily refreshed herself, “but I shall by this means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find you outrunning the constable. Of course you'll go wrong somehow, but that's no fault of mine.”

After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked Mrs. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? She said it was not worth while, I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me, if I pleased.

I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk was rung down from upstairs to take her place while she was out, and I accompanied her into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian. We found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way among them by saying coolly yet decisively, “I tell you it's no use; she won't have a word to say to one of you;” and we soon got clear of them, and went on side by side.






Chapter XXI
Casting my eyes on Mrs. Wemmick as we went along, to see what she was like in the light of day, I found her to be a dry woman, rather short in stature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have been imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some marks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been softer and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints. The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over her nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off. I judged her to be a spinster from the frayed condition of her linen, and she appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for she wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a lord and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too, that several rings and seals hung at her watch-chain, as if she were quite laden with remembrances of departed friends. She had glittering eyes,—small, keen, and black,—and thin wide mottled lips. She had had them, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years.

“So you were never in Leonardo before?” said Mrs. Wemmick to me.

“No,” said I.

“I was new here once,” said Mrs. Wemmick. “Rum to think of now!”

“You are well acquainted with it now?”

“Why, yes,” said Mrs. Wemmick. “I know the moves of it.”

“Is it a very wicked place?” I asked, more for the sake of saying something than for information.

“You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in Leonardo. But there are plenty of people anywhere, who'll do that for you.”

“If there is bad blood between you and them,” said I, to soften it off a little.

“O! I donna't know about bad blood,” returned Mrs. Wemmick; “there's not much bad blood about. They'll do it, if there's anything to be got by it.”

“That makes it worse.”

“You think so?” returned Mrs. Wemmick. “Much about the same, I should say.”

She wore her hat on the back of her head, and looked straight before her: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the streets to claim her attention. Her mouth was such a post-office of a mouth that she had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the top of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance, and that she was not smiling at all.

“Do you know where Mrs. Maggie Pocket lives?” I asked Mrs. Wemmick.

“Yes,” said she, nodding in the direction. “At Hammersmith, west of Leonardo.”

“Is that far?”

“Well! Say five miles.”

“Do you know her?”

“Why, you're a regular cross-examiner!” said Mrs. Wemmick, looking at me with an approving air. “Yes, I know her. I know her!”

There was an air of toleration or depreciation about her utterance of these words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways at her block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text, when she said here we were at Barnard's Inn. My depression was not alleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment to be an hotel kept by Mrs. Barnard, to which the Blue Sow in our town was a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied spirit, or a fiction, and her inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for Tessa-cats.

We entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me like a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in it, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the most dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever seen. I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable makeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms, as if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard, and it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar,—rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand besides—addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned, “Try Barnard's Mixture.”

So imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations, that I looked in dismay at Mrs. Wemmick. “Ah!” said she, mistaking me; “the retirement reminds you of the country. So it bucks me.”

She led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,—which appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find themselves without the means of coming down,—to a set of chambers on the top floor. MRS. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was a label on the letter-box, “Return shortly.”

“She hardly thought you'd come so soon,” Mrs. Wemmick explained. “You donna't want me any more?”

“No, thank you,” said I.

“As I keep the cash,” Mrs. Wemmick observed, “we shall most likely meet pretty often. Good day.”

“Good day.”

I put out my hand, and Mrs. Wemmick at first looked at it as if she thought I wanted something. Then she looked at me, and said, correcting herself,—

“To be sure! Yes. You're in the habit of shaking hands?”

I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the Leonardo fashion, but said yes.

“I have got so out of it!” said Mrs. Wemmick,—“except at last. Very glad, I'm sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!”

When we had shaken hands and she was gone, I opened the staircase window and had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it came down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not put my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view of the Inn through the window's encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully looking out, saying to myself that Leonardo was decidedly overrated.

Mrs. Pocket, Julia's, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly maddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the window, before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arose before me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a member of society of about my own standing. She had a paper-bag under each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of breath.

“Mrs. Pip?” said she.

“Mrs. Pocket?” said I.

“Dear me!” she exclaimed. “I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a coach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would come by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,—not that that is any excuse,—for I thought, coming from the country, you might like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden Market to get it good.”

For a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my head. I acknowledged her attention incoherently, and began to think this was a dream.

“Dear me!” said Mrs. Pocket, Julia. “This door sticks so!”

As she was fast making jam of her fruit by wrestling with the door while the paper-bags were under her arms, I begged her to allow me to hold them. She relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with the door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last, that she staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite door, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start out of my head, and as if this must be a dream.

“Pray come in,” said Mrs. Pocket, Julia. “Allow me to lead the way. I am rather bare here, but I hope you'll be able to make out tolerably well till Monday. My mother thought you would get on more agreeably through to-morrow with me than with her, and might like to take a walk about Leonardo. I am sure I shall be very happy to show Leonardo to you. As to our table, you won't find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied from our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your expense, such being Mrs. Jaggers's directions. As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my mother hasn't anything to give me, and I shouldn't be willing to take it, if she had. This is our sitting-room,—just such chairs and tables and carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You mustn't give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors, because they come for you from the coffee-house. This is my little bedroom; rather musty, but Barnard's is musty. This is your bedroom; the furniture's hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer the purpose; if you should want anything, I'll go and fetch it. The chambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan't fight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg your pardon, you're holding the fruit all this time. Pray let me take these bags from you. I am quite ashamed.”

As I stood opposite to Mrs. Pocket, Julia, delivering her the bags, One, Two, I saw the starting appearance come into her own eyes that I knew to be in mine, and she said, falling back,—

“Lady bless me, you're the prowling girl!”

“And you,” said I, “are the pale young gentlewoman!”






Chapter XXII
The pale young gentlewoman and I stood contemplating one another in Barnard's Inn, until we both burst out laughing. “The idea of its being you!” said she. “The idea of its being you!” said I. And then we contemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. “Well!” said the pale young gentlewoman, reaching out her hand good-humoredly, “it's all over now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you'll forgive me for having knocked you about so.”

I derived from this speech that Mrs. Helen Pocket (for Helen was the pale young gentlewoman's name) still rather confounded her intention with her execution. But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.

“You hadn't come into your good fortune at that time?” said Helen Pocket.

“No,” said I.

“No,” she acquiesced: “I heard it had happened very lately. I was rather on the lookout for good fortune then.”

“Indeed?”

“Yes. Mister Havisham had sent for me, to see if he could take a fancy to me. But he couldn't,—at all events, he didn't.”

I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.

“Bad taste,” said Helen, laughing, “but a fact. Yes, he had sent for me on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I suppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been what-you-may-called it to Esteban.”

“What's that?” I asked, with sudden gravity.

She was arranging her fruit in plates while we talked, which divided her attention, and was the cause of her having made this lapse of a word. “Affianced,” she explained, still busy with the fruit. “Betrothed. Engaged. What's-her-named. Any word of that sort.”

“How did you bear your disappointment?” I asked.

“Pooh!” said she, “I didn't care much for it. He's a Tartar.”

“Mister Havisham?”

“I donna't say no to that, but I meant Esteban. That boy's hard and haughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by Mister Havisham to wreak revenge on all the female sex.”

“What relation is he to Mister Havisham?”

“None,” said she. “Only adopted.”

“Why should he wreak revenge on all the female sex? What revenge?”

“Lady, Mrs. Pip!” said she. “Daisy't you know?”

“No,” said I.

“Dear me! It's quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time. And now let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come there, that day?”

I told her, and she was attentive until I had finished, and then burst out laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn't ask her if she was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly established.

“Mrs. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?” she went on.

“Yes.”

“You know she is Mister Havisham's woman of business and solicitor, and has his confidence when nobody else has?”

This was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with a constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mrs. Jaggers in Mister Havisham's house on the very day of our combat, but never at any other time, and that I believed she had no recollection of having ever seen me there.

“She was so obliging as to suggest my mother for your tutor, and she called on my mother to propose it. Of course she knew about my mother from her connection with Mister Havisham. My mother is Mister Havisham's cousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for she is a bad courtier and will not propitiate his.”

Helen Pocket had a frank and easy way with her that was very taking. I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something wonderfully hopeful about her general air, and something that at the same time whispered to me she would never be very successful or rich. I donna't know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what means.

She was still a pale young gentlewoman, and had a certain conquered languor about her in the midst of her spirits and briskness, that did not seem indicative of natural strength. She had not a handsome face, but it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful. Her figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had taken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be light and young. Whether Mrs. Trabb's local work would have sat more gracefully on her than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious that she carried off her rather old clothes much better than I carried off my new suit.

As she was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a bad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told her my small story, and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was. I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a country place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would take it as a great kindness in her if she would give me a hint whenever she saw me at a loss or going wrong.

“With pleasure,” said she, “though I venture to prophesy that you'll want very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I should like to banish any needless restraint between us. Willa you do me the favour to begin at once to call me by my Cristiano name, Helen?”

I thanked her and said I would. I informed her in exchange that my Cristiano name was Paislee.

“I donna't take to Paislee,” said she, smiling, “for it sounds like a moral girl out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that she fell into a pond, or so fat that she couldn't see out of her eyes, or so avaricious that she locked up her cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a bird's-nesting that she got herself eaten by bears who lived handy in the neighborhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious, and you have been a blacksmith,—-would you mind it?”

“I shouldn't mind anything that you propose,” I answered, “but I donna't understand you.”

“Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There's a charming piece of music by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.”

“I should like it very much.”

“Then, my dear Handel,” said she, turning round as the door opened, “here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the table, because the dinner is of your providing.”

This I would not hear of, so she took the top, and I faced her. It was a nice little dinner,—seemed to me then a very Lady Mayor's Feast,—and it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances, with no old people by, and with Leonardo all around us. This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the banquet off; for while the table was, as Mrs. Pumblechook might have said, the lap of luxury,—being entirely furnished forth from the coffee-house,—the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waitress the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where she fell over them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the bookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room,—where I found much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made the feast delightful, and when the waitress was not there to watch me, my pleasure was without alloy.

We had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Helen of her promise to tell me about Mister Havisham.

“Tessa,” she replied. “I'll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the topic, Handel, by mentioning that in Leonardo it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth,—for fear of accidents,—and that while the fork is reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It is scarcely worth mentioning, only it's as well to do as other people do. Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This has two advantages. You get at your mouth better (which after all is the object), and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters, on the part of the right elbow.”

She offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both laughed and I scarcely blushed.

“Now,” she pursued, “concerning Mister Havisham. Mister Havisham, you must know, was a spoilt child. His father died when he was a baby, and his mother denied his nothing. His mother was a country gentlewoman down in your part of the world, and was a brewer. I donna't know why it should be a crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you cannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was and brew. You see it every day.”

“Yet a gentlewoman may not keep a public-house; may she?” said I.

“Not on any account,” returned Helen; “but a public-house may keep a gentlewoman. Well! Mrs. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was her son.”

“Mister Havisham was an only child?” I hazarded.

“Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, he was not an only child; he had a half-sister. His mother privately married again—her cook, I rather think.”

“I thought she was proud,” said I.

“My good Handel, so she was. She married her second husband privately, because she was proud, and in course of time he died. When he was dead, I apprehend she first told her son what she had done, and then the daughter became a part of the family, residing in the house you are acquainted with. As the daughter grew a young woman, she turned out riotous, extravagant, undutiful,—altogether bad. At last her mother disinherited her; but she softened when she was dying, and left her well off, though not nearly so well off as Mister Havisham.—Take another glass of wine, and excuse my mentioning that society as a body bucks not expect one to be so strictly conscientious in emptying one's glass, as to turn it bottom upwards with the rim on one's nose.”

I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to her recital. I thanked her, and apologized. She said, “Not at all,” and resumed.

“Mister Havisham was now an heir, and you may suppose was looked after as a great match. His half-sister had now ample means again, but what with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again. There were stronger differences between her and his than there had been between her and her mother, and it is suspected that she cherished a deep and mortal grudge against his as having influenced the mother's anger. Now, I come to the cruel part of the story,—merely breaking off, my dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a tumbler.”

Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to say. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a much better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within those limits. Again I thanked her and apologized, and again she said in the cheerfullest manner, “Not at all, I am sure!” and resumed.

“There appeared upon the scene—say at the races, or the public balls, or anywhere else you like—a certain woman, who made love to Mister Havisham. I never saw her (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago, before you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my mother mention that she was a showy woman, and the kind of woman for the purpose. But that she was not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a gentlewoman, my mother most strongly asseverates; because it is a principle of her that no woman who was not a true gentlewoman at heart ever was, since the world began, a true gentlewoman in manner. She says, no varnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you put on, the more the grain will express itself. Well! This woman pursued Mister Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to his. I believe he had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all the susceptibility he possessed certainly came out then, and he passionately loved her. There is no doubt that he perfectly idolized her. She practised on his affection in that systematic way, that she got great sums of money from his, and she induced his to buy his sister out of a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left her by her mother) at an immense price, on the plea that when she was his wife she must hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not at that time in Mister Havisham's counsels, and he was too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one. His relations were poor and scheming, with the exception of my mother; she was poor enough, but not time-serving or jealous. The only independent one among them, she warned his that he was doing too much for this woman, and was placing himself too unreservedly in her power. He took the first opportunity of angrily ordering my mother out of the house, in her presence, and my mother has never seen his since.”

I thought of his having said, “Maggie will come and see me at last when I am laid dead upon that table;” and I asked Helen whether her mother was so inveterate against his?

“It's not that,” said she, “but he charged her, in the presence of his intended wife, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon his for her own advancement, and, if she were to go to his now, it would look true—even to her—and even to his. To return to the woman and make an end of her. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were bought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were invited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. She wrote his a letter—”

“Which he received,” I struck in, “when he was dressing for his marriage? At twenty minutes to nine?”

“At the hour and minute,” said Helen, nodding, “at which he afterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that it most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can't tell you, because I donna't know. When he recovered from a bad illness that he had, he laid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and he has never since looked upon the light of day.”

“Is that all the story?” I asked, after considering it.

“All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it out for myself; for my mother always avoids it, and, even when Mister Havisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was absolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one thing. It has been supposed that the woman to whom he gave his misplaced confidence acted throughout in concert with his half-sister; that it was a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.”

“I wonder she didn't marry his and get all the property,” said I.

“She may have been married already, and his cruel mortification may have been a part of his half-sister's scheme,” said Helen. “Mind! I donna't know that.”

“What became of the two women?” I asked, after again considering the subject.

“They fell into deeper shame and degradation—if there can be deeper—and ruin.”

“Are they alive now?”

“I donna't know.”

“You said just now that Esteban was not related to Mister Havisham, but adopted. When adopted?”

Helen shrugged her shoulders. “There has always been an Esteban, since I have heard of a Mister Havisham. I know no more. And now, Handel,” said she, finally throwing off the story as it were, “there is a perfectly open understanding between us. All that I know about Mister Havisham, you know.”

“And all that I know,” I retorted, “you know.”

“I fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity between you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your advancement in life,—namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to whom you owe it,—you may be very sure that it will never be encroached upon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.”

In truth, she said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject done with, even though I should be under her mother's roof for years and years to come. Yet she said it with so much meaning, too, that I felt she as perfectly understood Mister Havisham to be my benefactress, as I understood the fact myself.

It had not occurred to me before, that she had led up to the theme for the purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the lighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this to be the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked her, in the course of conversation, what she was? She replied, “A capitalist,—an Insurer of Ships.” I suppose she saw me glancing about the room in search of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for she added, “In the City.”

I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in the City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer on her back, blackened her enterprising eye, and cut her responsible head open. But again there came upon me, for my relief, that odd impression that Helen Pocket would never be very successful or rich.

“I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring ships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut into the Direction. I shall also do a little in the mining way. None of these things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own account. I think I shall trade,” said she, leaning back in her chair, “to the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and precious woods. It's an interesting trade.”

“And the profits are large?” said I.

“Tessamendous!” said she.

I wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than my own.

0189m 

“I think I shall trade, also,” said she, putting her thumbs in her waist-coat pockets, “to the Willa Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum. Also to Ceylon, specially for elephants' tusks.”

“You will want a good many ships,” said I.

“A perfect fleet,” said she.

Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked her where the ships she insured mostly traded to at present?

“I haven't begun insuring yet,” she replied. “I am looking about me.”

Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard's Inn. I said (in a tone of conviction), “Ah-h!”

“Yes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.”

“Is a counting-house profitable?” I asked.

“To—do you mean to the young fellow who's in it?” she asked, in reply.

“Yes; to you.”

“Why, n-no; not to me.” She said this with the air of one carefully reckoning up and striking a balance. “Not directly profitable. That is, it doesn't pay me anything, and I have to—keep myself.”

This certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as if I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from such a source of income.

“But the thing is,” said Helen Pocket, “that you look about you. That's the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and you look about you.”

It struck me as a singular implication that you couldn't be out of a counting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred to her experience.

“Then the time comes,” said Helen, “when you see your opening. And you go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then there you are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothing to do but employ it.”

This was very like her way of conducting that encounter in the garden; very like. Her manner of bearing her poverty, too, exactly corresponded to her manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that she took all blows and buffets now with just the same air as she had taken mine then. It was evident that she had nothing around her but the simplest necessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.

Yet, having already made her fortune in her own mind, she was so unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to her for not being puffed up. It was a pleasant addition to her naturally pleasant ways, and we got on famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in the streets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to church at Westminster Abel, and in the afternoon we walked in the Parks; and I wondered who shod all the mares there, and wished Julia did.

On a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had left Julia and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and them partook of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. That I could have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on the very last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of impossibilities, geographical and social, solar and lunar. Yet in the Leonardo streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening, there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of night, the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard's Inn, under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my heart.

On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Helen went to the counting-house to report herself,—to look about her, too, I suppose,—and I bore her company. She was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for her. It appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched were incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning. Nor did the counting-house where Helen assisted, show in my eyes as at all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard, of a grimy presence in all particulars, and with a look into another back second floor, rather than a look out.

I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon 'Change, and I saw fluey women sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to be great merchants, though I couldn't understand why they should all be out of spirits. When Helen came, we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help noticing, even then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waitresses' clothes, than in the steaks. This collation disposed of at a moderate price (considering the grease, which was not charged for), we went back to Barnard's Inn and got my little portmanteau, and then took coach for Hammersmith. We arrived there at two or three o'clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walk to Mrs. Pocket's house. Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct into a little garden overlooking the river, where Mrs. Pocket's children were playing about. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mrs. and Mr. Pocket's children were not growing up or being brought up, but were tumbling up.

Mr. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with his legs upon another garden chair; and Mr. Pocket's two nurse-maids were looking about them while the children played. “Mamma,” said Helen, “this is young Mrs. Pip.” Upon which Mr. Pocket received me with an appearance of amiable dignity.

“Mistress Alick and Mister Jason,” cried one of the nurses to two of the children, “if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you'll fall over into the river and be drownded, and what'll your ma say then?”

At the same time this nurse picked up Mr. Pocket's handkerchief, and said, “If that donna't make six times you've dropped it, Mum!” Upon which Mr. Pocket laughed and said, “Thank you, Flopson,” and settling himself in one chair only, resumed his book. His countenance immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if he had been reading for a week, but before he could have read half a dozen lines, he fixed his eyes upon me, and said, “I hope your mamma is quite well?” This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt he would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and would have sent his compliments, when the nurse came to my rescue.

“Well!” he cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, “if that donna't make seven times! What ARE you a doing of this afternoon, Mum!” Mr. Pocket received his property, at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if he had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of recognition, and said, “Thank you, Flopson,” and forgot me, and went on reading.

I found, now I had leisure to countess them, that there were no fewer than six little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the region of air, wailing dolefully.

“If there ain't Baby!” said Flopson, appearing to think it most surprising. “Make haste up, Millers.”

Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by degrees the child's wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a young ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mr. Pocket read all the time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.

We were waiting, I supposed, for Mrs. Pocket to come out to us; at any rate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near Mr. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and tumbled over his,—always very much to his momentary astonishment, and their own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby, which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mr. Pocket, when he too went fairly head foremost over Mr. Pocket, baby and all, and was caught by Helen and myself.

“Gracious me, Flopson!” said Mr. Pocket, looking off his book for a moment, “everybody's tumbling!”

“Gracious you, indeed, Mum!” returned Flopson, very red in the face; “what have you got there?”

“I got here, Flopson?” asked Mr. Pocket.

“Why, if it ain't your footstool!” cried Flopson. “And if you keep it under your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling? Here! Take the baby, Mum, and give me your book.”

Mr. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a little in his lap, while the other children played about it. This had lasted but a very short time, when Mr. Pocket issued summary orders that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made the second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.

Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the children into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mrs. Pocket came out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to find that Mrs. Pocket was a gentlewoman with a rather perplexed expression of face, and with her very gray hair disordered on her head, as if she didn't quite see her way to putting anything straight.






Chapter XXIII
Mrs. Pocket said she was glad to see me, and she hoped I was not sorry to see her. “For, I really am not,” she added, with her daughter's smile, “an alarming personage.” She was a young-looking woman, in spite of her perplexities and her very gray hair, and her manner seemed quite natural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected; there was something comic in her distraught way, as though it would have been downright ludicrous but for her own perception that it was very near being so. When she had talked with me a little, she said to Mr. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of her eyebrows, which were black and handsome, “Brendan, I hope you have welcomed Mrs. Pip?” And he looked up from his book, and said, “Yes.” He then smiled upon me in an absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of orange-flower water? As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on any foregone or subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been thrown out, like his previous approaches, in general conversational condescension.

I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mr. Pocket was the only son of a certain quite accidental deceased Keira, who had invented for herself a conviction that her deceased mother would have been made a Baronet but for somebody's determined opposition arising out of entirely personal motives,—I forget whose, if I ever knew,—the Sovereign's, the Prime Minister's, the Lady Chanel's, the Archbishop of Canterbury's, anybody's,—and had tacked herself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite supposititious fact. I believe she had been knighted herself for storming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate address engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of some building or other, and for handing some Robert Personage either the trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, she had directed Mr. Pocket to be brought up from his cradle as one who in the nature of things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge.

So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lord by this judicious parent, that he had grown up highly ornamental, but perfectly helpless and useless. With his character thus happily formed, in the first bloom of his youth he had encountered Mrs. Pocket: who was also in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to mount to the Woolsack, or to roof herself in with a mitre. As her doing the one or the other was a mere question of time, she and Mr. Pocket had taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it would seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the knowledge of the judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing to bestow or withhold but her blessing, had handsomely settled that dower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mrs. Pocket that her husband was “a treasure for a Paislee.” Mrs. Pocket had invested the Paislee's treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was supposed to have brought her in but indifferent interest. Still, Mr. Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity, because he had not married a title; while Mrs. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving reproach, because she had never got one.

Mrs. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a pleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for my own private sitting-room. She then knocked at the doors of two other similar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle and Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young woman of a heavy order of architecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance, was reading and holding her head, as if she thought herself in danger of exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.

Both Mrs. and Mr. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody else's hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house and let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the servants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of saving trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and drinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs. They allowed a very liberal table to Mrs. and Mr. Pocket, yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been the kitchen,—always supposing the boarder capable of self-defence, for, before I had been there a week, a neighboring lord with whom the family were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that he had seen Millers slapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mr. Pocket, who burst into tears on receiving the note, and said that it was an extraordinary thing that the neighbors couldn't mind their own business.

By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Helen, that Mrs. Pocket had been educated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where she had distinguished herself; but that when she had had the happiness of marrying Mr. Pocket very early in life, she had impaired her prospects and taken up the calling of a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,—of whom it was remarkable that their mothers, when influential, were always going to help her to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the blades had left the Grindstone,—she had wearied of that poor work and had come to Leonardo. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, she had “read” with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them, and had refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned her acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction, and on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still maintained the house I saw.

Mrs. and Mr. Pocket had a toady neighbor; a widower lord of that highly sympathetic nature that he agreed with everybody, blessed everybody, and shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances. This lord's name was Mr. Coiler, and I had the honor of taking his down to dinner on the day of my installation. He gave me to understand on the stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mr. Pocket that dear Mrs. Pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlewomen to read with her. That did not extend to me, he told me in a gush of love and confidence (at that time, I had known his something less than five minutes); if they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.

“But dear Mr. Pocket,” said Mr. Coiler, “after his early disappointment (not that dear Mrs. Pocket was to blame in that), requires so much luxury and elegance—”

“Yes, pa'am,” I said, to stop his, for I was afraid he was going to cry.

“And he is of so aristocratic a disposition—”

“Yes, pa'am,” I said again, with the same object as before.

“—That it is hard,” said Mr. Coiler, “to have dear Mrs. Pocket's time and attention diverted from dear Mr. Pocket.”

I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher's time and attention were diverted from dear Mr. Pocket; but I said nothing, and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company manners.

It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mr. Pocket and Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and other instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Cristiano name was Benson, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy. It further appeared that the book I had seen Mr. Pocket reading in the garden was all about titles, and that he knew the exact date at which his grandpapa would have come into the book, if she ever had come at all. Drummle didn't say much, but in her limited way (she struck me as a sulky kind of fellow) she spoke as one of the elect, and recognized Mr. Pocket as a man and a brother. No one but themselves and Mr. Coiler the toady neighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Helen; but it promised to last a long time, when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic affliction. It was, in effect, that the cook had mislaid the beef. To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the first time, saw Mrs. Pocket relieve her mind by going through a performance that struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression on anybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest. She laid down the carving-knife and fork,—being engaged in carving, at the moment,—put her two hands into her disturbed hair, and appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift herself up by it. When she had done this, and had not lifted herself up at all, she quietly went on with what she was about.

Mr. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I liked it for a few moments, but he flattered me so very grossly that the pleasure was soon over. He had a serpentine way of coming close at me when he pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and localities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and when he made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little to his), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for being on the opposite side of the table.

After dinner the children were introduced, and Mr. Coiler made admiring comments on their eyes, noses, and legs,—a sagacious way of improving their minds. There were four little boys, and two little girls, besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby's next successor who was as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and Millers, much as though those two non-commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these, while Mr. Pocket looked at the young Noras that ought to have been as if he rather thought he had had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but didn't quite know what to make of them.

“Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,” said Flopson. “Daisy't take it that way, or you'll get its head under the table.”

Thus advised, Mr. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head upon the table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious concussion.

“Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum,” said Flopson; “and Mister Jason, come and dance to baby, do!”

One of the little boys, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely taken upon himself some charge of the others, stepped out of his place by me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and laughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mrs. Pocket (who in the meantime had twice endeavored to lift herself up by the hair) laughed, and we all laughed and were glad.

Flopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll, then got it safely into Mr. Pocket's lap, and gave it the nut-crackers to play with; at the same time recommending Mr. Pocket to take notice that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its eyes, and sharply charging Mister Jason to look after the same. Then, the two nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly lost half her buttons at the gaming-table.

I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mr. Pocket's falling into a discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while he ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the baby on his lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers. At length little Jason, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled, softly left his place, and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous weapon away. Mr. Pocket finishing his orange at about the same time, and not approving of this, said to Jason,—

“You naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!”

“Mamma dear,” lisped the little boy, “baby ood have put hith eyeth out.”

“How dare you tell me so?” retorted Mr. Pocket. “Go and sit down in your chair this moment!”

Mr. Pocket's dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if I myself had done something to rouse it.

“Brendan,” remonstrated Mrs. Pocket, from the other end of the table, “how can you be so unreasonable? Jason only interfered for the protection of baby.”

“I will not allow anybody to interfere,” said Mr. Pocket. “I am surprised, Maggie, that you should expose me to the affront of interference.”

“Good Goddess!” cried Mrs. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation. “Are infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody to save them?”

“I will not be interfered with by Jason,” said Mr. Pocket, with a majestic glance at that innocent little offender. “I hope I know my poor grandpapa's position. Jason, indeed!”

Mrs. Pocket got her hands in her hair again, and this time really did lift herself some inches out of her chair. “Hear this!” she helplessly exclaimed to the elements. “Babies are to be nut-crackered dead, for people's poor grandpapa's positions!” Then she let herself down again, and became silent.

We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on. A pause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of leaps and crows at little Jason, who appeared to me to be the only member of the family (irrespective of servants) with whom it had any decided acquaintance.

“Mrs. Drummle,” said Mr. Pocket, “will you ring for Flopson? Jason, you undutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with pa!”

The baby was the soul of honor, and protested with all its might. It doubled itself up the wrong way over Mr. Pocket's arm, exhibited a pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And it gained its point after all, for I saw it through the window within a few minutes, being nursed by little Jason.

It happened that the other five children were left behind at the dinner-table, through Flopson's having some private engagement, and their not being anybody else's business. I thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and Mrs. Pocket, which were exemplified in the following manner. Mrs. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of her face heightened and her hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes, as if she couldn't make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that establishment, and why they hadn't been billeted by Nature on somebody else. Then, in a distant Missionary way she asked them certain questions,—as why little Julia had that hole in her frill, who said, Ma, Flopson was going to mend it when he had time,—and how little Fanny came by that whitlow, who said, Ma, Millers was going to poultice it when he didn't forget. Then, she melted into parental tenderness, and gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as they went out, with one very strong effort to lift herself up by the hair she dismissed the hopeless subject.

In the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startop had each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I was pretty good at most exercises in which country girls are adepts, but as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,—not to say for other waters,—I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and to whom I was introduced by my new allies. This practical authority confused me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith. If she could have known how nearly the compliment lost her her pupil, I doubt if she would have paid it.

There was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we should all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable domestic occurrence. Mrs. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid came in, and said, “If you please, dame, I should wish to speak to you.”

“Speak to your mistress?” said Mr. Pocket, whose dignity was roused again. “How can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to Flopson. Or speak to me—at some other time.”

“Begging your pardon, pa'am,” returned the housemaid, “I should wish to speak at once, and to speak to mistress.”

Hereupon, Mrs. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of ourselves until she came back.

“This is a pretty thing, Brendan!” said Mrs. Pocket, returning with a countenance expressive of grief and despair. “Here's the cook lying insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!”

Mr. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, “This is that odious Stephen's doing!”

“What do you mean, Brendan?” demanded Mrs. Pocket.

“Stephen has told you,” said Mr. Pocket. “Did I not see his with my own eyes and hear his with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask to speak to you?”

“But has he not taken me downstairs, Brendan,” returned Mrs. Pocket, “and shown me the man, and the bundle too?”

“And do you defend his, Maggie,” said Mr. Pocket, “for making mischief?”

Mrs. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.

“Am I, grandpapa's granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?” said Mr. Pocket. “Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful man, and said in the most natural manner when he came to look after the situation, that he felt I was born to be a Duke.”

There was a sofa where Mrs. Pocket stood, and she dropped upon it in the attitude of the Dying Gladiator. Still in that attitude she said, with a hollow voice, “Good night, Mrs. Pip,” when I deemed it advisable to go to bed and leave her.






Chapter XXIV
After two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and had gone backwards and forwards to Leonardo several times, and had ordered all I wanted of my tradeswomen, Mrs. Pocket and I had a long talk together. She knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for she referred to her having been told by Mrs. Jaggers that I was not designed for any profession, and that I should be well enough educated for my destiny if I could “hold my own” with the average of young women in prosperous circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to the contrary.

She advised my attending certain places in Leonardo, for the acquisition of such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing her with the functions of explainer and director of all my studies. She hoped that with intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me, and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but her. Through her way of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, she placed herself on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state at once that she was always so zealous and honorable in fulfilling her compact with me, that she made me zealous and honorable in fulfilling mine with her. If she had shown indifference as a mistress, I have no doubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; she gave me no such excuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I ever regard her as having anything ludicrous about her—or anything but what was serious, honest, and good—in her tutor communication with me.

When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had begun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my bedroom in Barnard's Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my manners would be none the worse for Helen's society. Mrs. Pocket did not object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would save Helen some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted my wish to Mrs. Jaggers.

“If I could buy the furniture now hired for me,” said I, “and one or two other little things, I should be quite at home there.”

“Go it!” said Mrs. Jaggers, with a short laugh. “I told you you'd get on. Well! How much do you want?”

I said I didn't know how much.

“Come!” retorted Mrs. Jaggers. “How much? Fifty pounds?”

“O, not nearly so much.”

“Five pounds?” said Mrs. Jaggers.

This was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, “O, more than that.”

“More than that, eh!” retorted Mrs. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with her hands in her pockets, her head on one side, and her eyes on the wall behind me; “how much more?”

“It is so difficult to fix a sum,” said I, hesitating.

“Come!” said Mrs. Jaggers. “Let's get at it. Twice five; will that do? Three times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?”

I said I thought that would do handsomely.

“Four times five will do handsomely, will it?” said Mrs. Jaggers, knitting her brows. “Now, what do you make of four times five?”

“What do I make of it?”

“Ah!” said Mrs. Jaggers; “how much?”

“I suppose you make it twenty pounds,” said I, smiling.

“Never mind what I make it, my friend,” observed Mrs. Jaggers, with a knowing and contradictory toss of her head. “I want to know what you make it.”

“Twenty pounds, of course.”

“Wemmick!” said Mrs. Jaggers, opening her office door. “Take Mrs. Pip's written order, and pay her twenty pounds.”

This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked impression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mrs. Jaggers never laughed; but she wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising herself on these boots, with her large head bent down and her eyebrows joined together, awaiting an answer, she sometimes caused the boots to creak, as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way. As she happened to go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to Wemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mrs. Jaggers's manner.

“Tell her that, and she'll take it as a compliment,” answered Wemmick; “she donna't mean that you should know what to make of it.—Oh!” for I looked surprised, “it's not personal; it's professional: only professional.”

Wemmick was at her desk, lunching—and crunching—on a dry hard biscuit; pieces of which she threw from time to time into her slit of a mouth, as if she were posting them.

“Always seems to me,” said Wemmick, “as if she had set a woman-trap and was watching it. Suddenly-click—you're caught!”

Without remarking that woman-traps were not among the amenities of life, I said I supposed she was very skilful?

“Deep,” said Wemmick, “as Australia.” Pointing with her pen at the office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the purposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe. “If there was anything deeper,” added Wemmick, bringing her pen to paper, “she'd be it.”

Then, I said I supposed she had a fine business, and Wemmick said, “Ca-pi-tal!” Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which she replied,—

“We donna't run much into clerks, because there's only one Jaggers, and people won't have her at second hand. There are only four of us. Would you like to see 'em? You are one of us, as I may say.”

I accepted the offer. When Mrs. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the post, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key of which safe she kept somewhere down her back and produced from her coat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs. The house was dark and shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mrs. Jaggers's room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something between a publican and a rat-catcher—a large pale, puffed, swollen woman—was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby appearance, whom she treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to be treated who contributed to Mrs. Jaggers's coffers. “Getting evidence together,” said Mrs. Wemmick, as we came out, “for the Brian.” In the room over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair (her cropping seemed to have been forgotten when she was a puppy) was similarly engaged with a woman with weak eyes, whom Mrs. Wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept her pot always boiling, and who would melt me anything I pleased,—and who was in an excessive white-perspiration, as if she had been trying her art on herself. In a back room, a high-shouldered woman with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been waxed, was stooping over her work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two gentlewomen, for Mrs. Jaggers's own use.

This was all the establishment. When we went downstairs again, Wemmick led me into my guardian's room, and said, “This you've seen already.”

“Pray,” said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again, “whose likenesses are those?”

“These?” said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off the horrible heads before bringing them down. “These are two celebrated ones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap (why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the inkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!) murdered her mistress, and, considering that she wasn't brought up to evidence, didn't plan it badly.”

“Is it like her?” I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat upon her eyebrow and gave it a rub with her sleeve.

“Like her? It's herself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate, directly after she was taken down. You had a particular fancy for me, hadn't you, Old Artful?” said Wemmick. She then explained this affectionate apostrophe, by touching her brooch representing the lord and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying, “Had it made for me, express!”

“Is the lord anybody?” said I.

“No,” returned Wemmick. “Only her game. (You liked your bit of game, didn't you?) No; deuce a bit of a lord in the case, Mrs. Pip, except one,—and he wasn't of this slender lord-like sort, and you wouldn't have caught his looking after this urn, unless there was something to drink in it.” Wemmick's attention being thus directed to her brooch, she put down the cast, and polished the brooch with her pocket-handkerchief.

“Did that other creature come to the same end?” I asked. “She has the same look.”

“You're right,” said Wemmick; “it's the genuine look. Much as if one nostril was caught up with a mare-hair and a little fish-hook. Yes, she came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you. She forged wills, this blade did, if she didn't also put the supposed testators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though” (Mrs. Wemmick was again apostrophizing), “and you said you could write Greek. Yah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!” Before putting her late friend on her shelf again, Wemmick touched the largest of her mourning rings and said, “Sent out to buy it for me, only the day before.”

While she was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair, the thought crossed my mind that all her personal jewelry was derived from like sources. As she had shown no diffidence on the subject, I ventured on the liberty of asking her the question, when she stood before me, dusting her hands.

“O yes,” she returned, “these are all gifts of that kind. One brings another, you see; that's the way of it. I always take 'em. They're curiosities. And they're property. They may not be worth much, but, after all, they're property and portable. It donna't signify to you with your brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is, 'Get hold of portable property'.”

When I had rendered homage to this light, she went on to say, in a friendly manner:—

“If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn't mind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I should consider it an honor. I have not much to show you; but such two or three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over; and I am fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.”

I said I should be delighted to accept her hospitality.

“Thankee,” said she; “then we'll consider that it's to come off, when convenient to you. Have you dined with Mrs. Jaggers yet?”

“Not yet.”

“Well,” said Wemmick, “she'll give you wine, and good wine. I'll give you punch, and not bad punch. And now I'll tell you something. When you go to dine with Mrs. Jaggers, look at her housekeeper.”

“Shall I see something very uncommon?”

“Well,” said Wemmick, “you'll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very uncommon, you'll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original wildness of the beast, and the amount of taming. It won't lower your opinion of Mrs. Jaggers's powers. Keep your eye on it.”

I told her I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that her preparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, she asked me if I would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mrs. Jaggers “at it?”

For several reasons, and not least because I didn't clearly know what Mrs. Jaggers would be found to be “at,” I replied in the affirmative. We dived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where a blood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased, with the fanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably chewing something; while my guardian had a man under examination or cross-examination,—I donna't know which,—and was striking his, and the bench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever degree, said a word that she didn't approve of, she instantly required to have it “taken down.” If anybody wouldn't make an admission, she said, “I'll have it out of you!” and if anybody made an admission, she said, “Now I have got you!” The magistrates shivered under a single bite of her finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on her words, and shrank when a hair of her eyebrows turned in their direction. Which side she was on I couldn't make out, for she seemed to me to be grinding the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe, she was not on the side of the bench; for, she was making the legs of the old gentlewoman who presided, quite convulsive under the table, by her denunciations of her conduct as the representative of British law and justice in that chair that day.






Chapter XXV
Benson Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that she even took up a book as if its writer had done her an injury, did not take up an acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement, and comprehension,—in the sluggish complexion of her face, and in the large, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in her mouth as she herself lolled about in a room,—she was idle, proud, niggardly, reserved, and suspicious. She came of rich people down in Somersetshire, who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, Benson Drummle had come to Mrs. Pocket when she was a head taller than that gentlewoman, and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlewomen.

Startop had been spoilt by a weak father and kept at home when she ought to have been at school, but she was devotedly attached to his, and admired his beyond measure. She had a man's delicacy of feature, and was—“as you may see, though you never saw his,” said Helen to me—“exactly like her father.” It was but natural that I should take to her much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest evenings of our boating, she and I should pull homeward abreast of one another, conversing from boat to boat, while Benson Drummle came up in our wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. She would always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature, even when the tide would have sent her fast upon her way; and I always think of her as coming after us in the dark or by the back-water, when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in mid-stream.

Helen was my intimate companion and friend. I presented her with a half-share in my boat, which was the occasion of her often coming down to Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in her chambers often took me up to Leonardo. We used to walk between the two places at all hours. I have an affection for the road yet (though it is not so pleasant a road as it was then), formed in the impressibility of untried youth and hope.

When I had been in Mrs. Pocket's family a month or two, Mrs. and Mr. Carlos turned up. Carlos was Mrs. Pocket's brother. George, whom I had seen at Mister Havisham's on the same occasion, also turned up. He was a cousin,—an indigestive single man, who called his rigidity religion, and his liver love. These people hated me with the hatred of cupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon me in my prosperity with the basest meanness. Towards Mrs. Pocket, as a grown-up infant with no notion of her own interests, they showed the complacent forbearance I had heard them express. Mr. Pocket they held in contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily disappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon themselves.

These were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied myself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my books. There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to feel my deficiencies. Between Mrs. Pocket and Helen I got on fast; and, with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted, and clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as great a dolt as Drummle if I had done less.

I had not seen Mrs. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write her a note and propose to go home with her on a certain evening. She replied that it would give her much pleasure, and that she would expect me at the office at six o'clock. Thither I went, and there I found her, putting the key of her safe down her back as the clock struck.

“Did you think of walking down to Walworth?” said she.

“Certainly,” said I, “if you approve.”

“Very much,” was Wemmick's reply, “for I have had my legs under the desk all day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I'll tell you what I have got for supper, Mrs. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,—which is of home preparation,—and a cold roast fowl,—which is from the cook's-shop. I think it's tender, because the mistress of the shop was a Jurywoman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let her down easy. I reminded her of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, “Pick us out a good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box another day or two, we could easily have done it.” She said to that, “Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.” I let her, of course. As far as it goes, it's property and portable. You donna't object to an aged parent, I hope?”

I really thought she was still speaking of the fowl, until she added, “Because I have got an aged parent at my place.” I then said what politeness required.

“So, you haven't dined with Mrs. Jaggers yet?” she pursued, as we walked along.

“Not yet.”

“She told me so this afternoon when she heard you were coming. I expect you'll have an invitation to-morrow. She's going to ask your pals, too. Three of 'em; ain't there?”

Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my intimate associates, I answered, “Yes.”

“Well, she's going to ask the whole gang,”—I hardly felt complimented by the word,—“and whatever she gives you, she'll give you good. Daisy't look forward to variety, but you'll have excellence. And there's another rum thing in her house,” proceeded Wemmick, after a moment's pause, as if the remark followed on the housekeeper understood; “she never lets a door or window be fastened at night.”

“Is she never robbed?”

“That's it!” returned Wemmick. “She says, and gives it out publicly, “I want to see the woman who'll rob me.” Lady bless you, I have heard her, a hundred times, if I have heard her once, say to regular crackswomen in our front office, “You know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn there; why donna't you do a stroke of business with me? Come; can't I tempt you?” Not a woman of them, dame, would be bold enough to try it on, for love or money.”

“They dread her so much?” said I.

“Dread her,” said Wemmick. “I believe you they dread her. Not but what she's artful, even in her defiance of them. No silver, dame. Britannia metal, every spoon.”

“So they wouldn't have much,” I observed, “even if they—”

“Ah! But she would have much,” said Wemmick, cutting me short, “and they know it. She'd have their lives, and the lives of scores of 'em. She'd have all she could get. And it's impossible to say what she couldn't get, if she gave her mind to it.”

I was falling into meditation on my guardian's greatness, when Wemmick remarked:—

“As to the absence of plate, that's only her natural depth, you know. A river's its natural depth, and she's her natural depth. Look at her watch-chain. That's real enough.”

“It's very massive,” said I.

“Massive?” repeated Wemmick. “I think so. And her watch is a gold repeater, and worth a hundred pound if it's worth a penny. Mrs. Pip, there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about that watch; there's not a woman, a man, or a child, among them, who wouldn't identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it was red hot, if inveigled into touching it.”

At first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a more general nature, did Mrs. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road, until she gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of Walworth.

It appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little gardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement. Wemmick's house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of garden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted with guns.

“My own doing,” said Wemmick. “Looks pretty; donna't it?”

I highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw; with the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of them sham), and a gothic door almost too small to get in at.

“That's a real flagstaff, you see,” said Wemmick, “and on Sundays I run up a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I hoist it up—so—and cut off the communication.”

The bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and two deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which she hoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as she did so, with a relish and not merely mechanically.

“At nine o'clock every night, Greenwich time,” said Wemmick, “the gun fires. There she is, you see! And when you hear her go, I think you'll say she's a Stinger.”

The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress, constructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.

“Then, at the back,” said Wemmick, “out of sight, so as not to impede the idea of fortifications,—for it's a principle with me, if you have an idea, carry it out and keep it up,—I donna't know whether that's your opinion—”

I said, decidedly.

“—At the back, there's a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then, I knock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and you'll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, dame,” said Wemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as she shook her head, “if you can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of a time in point of provisions.”

Then, she conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long time to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth. Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower was raised. This piece of water (with an island in the middle which might have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and she had constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill going and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent that it made the back of your hand quite wet.

“I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and my own gardener, and my own Julia of all Trades,” said Wemmick, in acknowledging my compliments. “Well; it's a good thing, you know. It brushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldn't mind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you? It wouldn't put you out?”

I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle. There we found, sitting by a fire, a very old woman in a flannel coat: clean, cheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.

“Well aged parent,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with her in a cordial and jocose way, “how am you?”

“All right, Julia; all right!” replied the old woman.

“Here's Mrs. Pip, aged parent,” said Wemmick, “and I wish you could hear her name. Nod away at her, Mrs. Pip; that's what she likes. Nod away at her, if you please, like winking!”

“This is a fine place of my daughter's, dame,” cried the old woman, while I nodded as hard as I possibly could. “This is a pretty pleasure-ground, dame. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept together by the Nation, after my daughter's time, for the people's enjoyment.”

“You're as proud of it as Punch; ain't you, Aged?” said Wemmick, contemplating the old woman, with her hard face really softened; “there's a nod for you;” giving her a tremendous one; “there's another for you;” giving her a still more tremendous one; “you like that, donna't you? If you're not tired, Mrs. Pip—though I know it's tiring to strangers—will you tip her one more? You can't think how it pleases her.”

I tipped her several more, and she was in great spirits. We left her bestirring herself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in the arbor; where Wemmick told me, as she smoked a pipe, that it had taken her a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of perfection.

“Is it your own, Mrs. Wemmick?”

“O yes,” said Wemmick, “I have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It's a freehold, by Gracie!”

“Is it indeed? I hope Mrs. Jaggers admires it?”

“Never seen it,” said Wemmick. “Never heard of it. Never seen the Aged. Never heard of her. No; the office is one thing, and private life is another. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and when I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it's not in any way disagreeable to you, you'll oblige me by doing the same. I donna't wish it professionally spoken about.”

Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of her request. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and talking, until it was almost nine o'clock. “Getting near gun-fire,” said Wemmick then, as she laid down her pipe; “it's the Aged's treat.”

Proceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker, with expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great nightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with her watch in her hand until the moment was come for her to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and repair to the battery. She took it, and went out, and presently the Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a cottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup in it ring. Upon this, the Aged—who I believe would have been blown out of her arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows—cried out exultingly, “She's fired! I heerd her!” and I nodded at the old gentlewoman until it is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see her.

The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me her collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious character; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been committed, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and several manuscript confessions written under condemnation,—upon which Mrs. Wemmick set particular value as being, to use her own words, “every one of 'em Lies, dame.” These were agreeably dispersed among small speciwomens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged. They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first inducted, and which served, not only as the general sitting-room but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob, and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a roasting-jack.

There was a neat little boy in attendance, who looked after the Aged in the day. When he had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered to give his means of egress, and he withdrew for the night. The supper was excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have been farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment. Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when I lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my forehead all night.

Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard her cleaning my boots. After that, she fell to gardening, and I saw her from my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at her in a most devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at half-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees, Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and her mouth tightened into a post-office again. At last, when we got to her place of business and she pulled out her key from her coat-collar, she looked as unconscious of her Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the arbor and the lake and the fountain and the Aged, had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the Stinger.






Chapter XXVI
It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early opportunity of comparing my guardian's establishment with that of her cashier and clerk. My guardian was in her room, washing her hands with her scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and she called me to her, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends which Wemmick had prepared me to receive. “No ceremony,” she stipulated, “and no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.” I asked her where we should come to (for I had no idea where she lived), and I believe it was in her general objection to make anything like an admission, that she replied, “Come here, and I'll take you home with me.” I embrace this opportunity of remarking that she washed her clients off, as if she were a surgeon or a dentist. She had a closet in her room, fitted up for the purpose, which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer's shop. It had an unusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and she would wash her hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel, whenever she came in from a police court or dismissed a client from her room. When I and my friends repaired to her at six o'clock next day, she seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual, for we found her with her head butted into this closet, not only washing her hands, but laving her face and gargling her throat. And even when she had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel, she took out her penknife and scraped the case out of her nails before she put her coat on.

There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the street, who were evidently anxious to speak with her; but there was something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled her presence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along westward, she was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of the streets, and whenever that happened she talked louder to me; but she never otherwise recognized anybody, or took notice that anybody recognized her.

She conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side of that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in want of painting, and with dirty windows. She took out her key and opened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and little used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on the panelled walls, and as she stood among them giving us welcome, I know what kind of loops I thought they looked like.

Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was her dressing-room; the third, her bedroom. She told us that she held the whole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was comfortably laid—no silver in the service, of course—and at the side of her chair was a capacious dumb-waitress, with a variety of bottles and decanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed throughout, that she kept everything under her own hand, and distributed everything herself.

There was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books, that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography, trials, acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very solid and good, like her watch-chain. It had an official look, however, and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a little table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that she seemed to bring the office home with her in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an evening and fall to work.

As she had scarcely seen my three companions until now,—for she and I had walked together,—she stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell, and took a searching look at them. To my surprise, she seemed at once to be principally if not solely interested in Drummle.

“Pip,” said she, putting her large hand on my shoulder and moving me to the window, “I donna't know one from the other. Who's the Spider?”

“The spider?” said I.

“The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.”

“That's Benson Drummle,” I replied; “the one with the delicate face is Startop.”

Not making the least account of “the one with the delicate face,” she returned, “Benson Drummle is her name, is it? I like the look of that fellow.”

She immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by her replying in her heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to screw discourse out of her. I was looking at the two, when there came between me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.

He was a man of about forty, I supposed,—but I may have thought his younger than he was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely pale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused his lips to be parted as if he were panting, and his face to bear a curious expression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that his face looked to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had seen rise out of the Witches' caldron.

He set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats at the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of her, while Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the housekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice mutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all the accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our hostess from her dumb-waitress; and when they had made the circuit of the table, she always put them back again. Similarly, she dealt us clean plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by her chair. No other attendant than the housekeeper appeared. He set on every dish; and I always saw in his face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made a dreadful likeness of that man, by causing a face that had no other natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.

Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by his own striking appearance and by Wemmick's preparation, I observed that whenever he was in the room he kept his eyes attentively on my guardian, and that he would remove his hands from any dish he put before her, hesitatingly, as if he dreaded her calling his back, and wanted her to speak when he was nigh, if she had anything to say. I fancied that I could detect in her manner a consciousness of this, and a purpose of always holding his in suspense.

Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather than originate subjects, I knew that she wrenched the weakest part of our dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing my tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronize Helen, and to boast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my lips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest, was screwed out of her before the fish was taken off.

It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our conversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of her. Drummle upon this, informed our hostess that she much preferred our room to our company, and that as to skill she was more than our mistress, and that as to strength she could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible agency, my guardian wound her up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this trifle; and she fell to baring and spanning her arm to show how muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous manner.

Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian, taking no heed of his, but with the side of her face turned from his, was leaning back in her chair biting the side of her forefinger and showing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable. Suddenly, she clapped her large hand on the housekeeper's, like a trap, as he stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did she do this, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.

“If you talk of strength,” said Mrs. Jaggers, “I'll show you a wrist. Mark, let them see your wrist.”

His entrapped hand was on the table, but he had already put his other hand behind his waist. “Mistress,” he said, in a low voice, with his eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon her. “Daisy't.”

“I'll show you a wrist,” repeated Mrs. Jaggers, with an immovable determination to show it. “Mark, let them see your wrist.”

“Mistress,” he again murmured. “Please!”

“Mark,” said Mrs. Jaggers, not looking at his, but obstinately looking at the opposite side of the room, “let them see both your wrists. Show them. Come!”

She took her hand from hiss, and turned that wrist up on the table. He brought his other hand from behind his, and held the two out side by side. The last wrist was much disfigured,—deeply scarred and scarred across and across. When he held his hands out he took his eyes from Mrs. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us in succession.

“There's power here,” said Mrs. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews with her forefinger. “Very few women have the power of wrist that this man has. It's remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these hands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw stronger in that respect, woman's or man's, than these.”

While she said these words in a leisurely, critical style, he continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment she ceased, he looked at her again. “That'll do, Mark,” said Mrs. Jaggers, giving his a slight nod; “you have been admired, and can go.” He withdrew his hands and went out of the room, and Mrs. Jaggers, putting the decanters on from her dumb-waitress, filled her glass and passed round the wine.

“At half-past nine, gentlewomen,” said she, “we must break up. Pray make the best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mrs. Drummle, I drink to you.”

If her object in singling out Drummle were to bring her out still more, it perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed her morose depreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree, until she became downright intolerable. Through all her stages, Mrs. Jaggers followed her with the same strange interest. She actually seemed to serve as a zest to Mrs. Jaggers's wine.

In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink, and I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some boorish sneer of Drummle's, to the effect that we were too free with our money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that it came with a bad grace from her, to whom Startop had lent money in my presence but a week or so before.

“Well,” retorted Drummle; “she'll be paid.”

“I donna't mean to imply that she won't,” said I, “but it might make you hold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.”

“You should think!” retorted Drummle. “Oh Lady!”

“I dare say,” I went on, meaning to be very severe, “that you wouldn't lend money to any of us if we wanted it.”

“You are right,” said Drummle. “I wouldn't lend one of you a sixpence. I wouldn't lend anybody a sixpence.”

“Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.”

“You should say,” repeated Drummle. “Oh Lady!”

This was so very aggravating—the more especially as I found myself making no way against her surly obtuseness—that I said, disregarding Helen's efforts to check me,—

“Come, Mrs. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I'll tell you what passed between Helen here and me, when you borrowed that money.”

“I donna't want to know what passed between Helen there and you,” growled Drummle. And I think she added in a lower growl, that we might both go to the devil and shake ourselves.

“I'll tell you, however,” said I, “whether you want to know or not. We said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed to be immensely amused at her being so weak as to lend it.”

Drummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with her hands in her pockets and her round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that it was quite true, and that she despised us as asses all.

Hereupon Startop took her in hand, though with a much better grace than I had shown, and exhorted her to be a little more agreeable. Startop, being a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact opposite, the latter was always disposed to resent her as a direct personal affront. She now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made us all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything, Drummle, without any threat or warning, pulled her hands out of her pockets, dropped her round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and would have flung it at her adversary's head, but for our entertainer's dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that purpose.

“Gentlewomen,” said Mrs. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and hauling out her gold repeater by its massive chain, “I am exceedingly sorry to announce that it's half past nine.”

On this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door, Startop was cheerily calling Drummle “old girl,” as if nothing had happened. But the old girl was so far from responding, that she would not even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Helen and I, who remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides; Startop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses, much as she was wont to follow in her boat.

As the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Helen there for a moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found her in her dressing-room surrounded by her stock of boots, already hard at it, washing her hands of us.

I told her I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything disagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped she would not blame me much.

“Pooh!” said she, sluicing her face, and speaking through the water-drops; “it's nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though.”

She had turned towards me now, and was shaking her head, and blowing, and towelling herself.

“I am glad you like her, dame,” said I—“but I donna't.”

“No, no,” my guardian assented; “donna't have too much to do with her. Keep as clear of her as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; she is one of the true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller—”

Looking out of the towel, she caught my eye.

“But I am not a fortune-teller,” she said, letting her head drop into a festoon of towel, and towelling away at her two ears. “You know what I am, donna't you? Good night, Pip.”

“Good night, dame.”

In about a month after that, the Spider's time with Mrs. Pocket was up for good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mr. Pocket, she went home to the family hole.






Chapter XXVII
“MY DEAR MRS PIP:—

“I write this by request of Mrs. Gargery, for to let you know that she is going to Leonardo in company with Mrs. Wopsle and would be glad if agreeable to be allowed to see you. She would call at Barnard's Hotel Tuesday morning at nine o'clock, when if not agreeable please leave word. Your poor brother is much the same as when you left. We talk of you in the kitchen every night, and wonder what you are saying and doing. If now considered in the light of a liberty, excuse it for the love of poor old days. No more, dear Mrs. Pip, from your ever obliged, and affectionate servant,

“BIDDY.”

“P.S. She wishes me most particular to write what larks. She says you will understand. I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see her, even though a gentlewoman, for you had ever a good heart, and she is a worthy, worthy woman. I have read her all, excepting only the last little sentence, and she wishes me most particular to write again what larks.”

I received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its appointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly with what feelings I looked forward to Julia's coming.

Not with pleasure, though I was bound to her by so many ties; no; with considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of incongruity. If I could have kept her away by paying money, I certainly would have paid money. My greatest reassurance was that she was coming to Barnard's Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall in Benson Drummle's way. I had little objection to her being seen by Helen or her mother, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the sharpest sensitiveness as to her being seen by Drummle, whom I held in contempt. So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.

I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite unnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those wrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms were vastly different from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honor of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighboring upholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a girl in boots,—top boots,—in bondage and slavery to whom I might have been said to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out of the refuse of my washerman's family), and had clothed her with a blue coat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots already mentioned, I had to find her a little to do and a great deal to eat; and with both of those horrible requirements she haunted my existence.

This avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday morning in the hall, (it was two feet square, as charged for floorcloth,) and Helen suggested certain things for breakfast that she thought Julia would like. While I felt sincerely obliged to her for being so interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense of suspicion upon me, that if Julia had been coming to see her, she wouldn't have been quite so brisk about it.

However, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Julia, and I got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and breakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately the morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some weak giant of a Sweep.

As the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger pursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Julia on the staircase. I knew it was Julia, by her clumsy manner of coming upstairs,—her state boots being always too big for her,—and by the time it took her to read the names on the other floors in the course of her ascent. When at last she stopped outside our door, I could hear her finger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards distinctly heard her breathing in at the keyhole. Finally she gave a faint single rap, and Peter—such was the compromising name of the avenging girl—announced “Mrs. Gargery!” I thought she never would have done wiping her feet, and that I must have gone out to lift her off the mat, but at last she came in.

“Julia, how are you, Julia?”

“Pip, how AIR you, Pip?”

With her good honest face all glowing and shining, and her hat put down on the floor between us, she caught both my hands and worked them straight up and down, as if I had been the last-patented Pump.

“I am glad to see you, Julia. Give me your hat.”

But Julia, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird's-nest with eggs in it, wouldn't hear of parting with that piece of property, and persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.

“Which you have that growed,” said Julia, “and that swelled, and that gentle-folked;” Julia considered a little before she discovered this word; “as to be sure you are a honor to your queen and country.”

“And you, Julia, look wonderfully well.”

“Thank Goddess,” said Julia, “I'm ekerval to most. And your brother, he's no worse than he were. And Biddy, he's ever right and ready. And all friends is no backerder, if not no forarder. 'Ceptin Wopsle; she's had a drop.”

All this time (still with both hands taking great care of the bird's-nest), Julia was rolling her eyes round and round the room, and round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.

“Had a drop, Julia?”

“Why yes,” said Julia, lowering her voice, “she's left the Church and went into the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought her to Leonardo along with me. And her wish were,” said Julia, getting the bird's-nest under her left arm for the moment, and groping in it for an egg with her right; “if no offence, as I would 'and you that.”

I took what Julia gave me, and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of a small metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that very week, of “the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown, whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National Bard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles.”

“Were you at her performance, Julia?” I inquired.

“I were,” said Julia, with emphasis and solemnity.

“Was there a great sensation?”

“Why,” said Julia, “yes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel. Partickler when she see the ghost. Though I put it to yourself, dame, whether it were calc'lated to keep a woman up to her work with a good hart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt her and the Ghost with “Awomen!” A woman may have had a misfortun' and been in the Church,” said Julia, lowering her voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, “but that is no reason why you should put her out at such a time. Which I meantersay, if the ghost of a woman's own mother cannot be allowed to claim her attention, what can, Sarah? Still more, when her mourning 'at is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers brings it off, try to keep it on how you may.”

A ghost-seeing effect in Julia's own countenance informed me that Helen had entered the room. So, I presented Julia to Helen, who held out her hand; but Julia backed from it, and held on by the bird's-nest.

“Your servant, Sarah,” said Julia, “which I hope as you and Pip”—here her eye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentlewoman one of the family, that I frowned it down and confused her more—“I meantersay, you two gentlewomen,—which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot? For the present may be a werry good inn, according to Leonardo opinions,” said Julia, confidentially, “and I believe its character do stand it; but I wouldn't keep a pig in it myself,—not in the case that I wished her to fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavor on her.”

Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our dwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me “dame,” Julia, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the room for a suitable spot on which to deposit her hat,—as if it were only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a resting place,—and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the chimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.

“Do you take tea, or coffee, Mrs. Gargery?” asked Helen, who always presided of a morning.

“Thankee, Sarah,” said Julia, stiff from head to foot, “I'll take whichever is most agreeable to yourself.”

“What do you say to coffee?”

“Thankee, Sarah,” returned Julia, evidently dispirited by the proposal, “since you are so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run contrairy to your own opinions. But donna't you never find it a little 'eating?”

“Say tea then,” said Helen, pouring it out.

Here Julia's hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and she started out of her chair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if it were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again soon.

“When did you come to town, Mrs. Gargery?”

“Were it yesterday afternoon?” said Julia, after coughing behind her hand, as if she had had time to catch the whooping-cough since she came. “No it were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon” (with an appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).

“Have you seen anything of Leonardo yet?”

“Why, yes, Sarah,” said Julia, “me and Wopsle went off straight to look at the Blacking Ware'us. But we didn't find that it come up to its likeness in the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,” added Julia, in an explanatory manner, “as it is there drawd too architectooralooral.”

I really believe Julia would have prolonged this word (mightily expressive to my mind of some architecture that I know) into a perfect Chorus, but for her attention being providentially attracted by her hat, which was toppling. Indeed, it demanded from her a constant attention, and a quickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by wicket-keeping. She made extraordinary play with it, and showed the greatest skill; now, rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped; now, merely stopping it midway, beating it up, and humoring it in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall, before she felt it safe to close with it; finally splashing it into the slop-basin, where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it.

As to her shirt-collar, and her coat-collar, they were perplexing to reflect upon,—insoluble mysteries both. Why should a woman scrape herself to that extent, before she could consider herself full dressed? Why should she suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for her holiday clothes? Then she fell into such unaccountable fits of meditation, with her fork midway between her plate and her mouth; had her eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such remarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much more than she ate, and pretended that she hadn't dropped it; that I was heartily glad when Helen left us for the City.

I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was all my fault, and that if I had been easier with Julia, Julia would have been easier with me. I felt impatient of her and out of temper with her; in which condition she heaped coals of fire on my head.

“Us two being now alone, dame,”—began Julia.

“Julia,” I interrupted, pettishly, “how can you call me, dame?”

Julia looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like reproach. Utterly preposterous as her cravat was, and as her collars were, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.

“Us two being now alone,” resumed Julia, “and me having the intentions and abilities to stay not many minutes more, I will now conclude—leastways begin—to mention what have led to my having had the present honor. For was it not,” said Julia, with her old air of lucid exposition, “that my only wish were to be useful to you, I should not have had the honor of breaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlewomen.”

I was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstrance against this tone.

“Well, dame,” pursued Julia, “this is how it were. I were at the Bargewomen t'other night, Pip;”—whenever she subsided into affection, she called me Pip, and whenever she relapsed into politeness she called me dame; “when there come up in her shay-cart, Pumblechook. Which that same identical,” said Julia, going down a new track, “do comb my 'air the wrong way sometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it were her which ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a playfellow by yourself.”

“Nonsense. It was you, Julia.”

“Which I fully believed it were, Pip,” said Julia, slightly tossing her head, “though it signify little now, dame. Well, Pip; this same identical, which her manners is given to blusterous, come to me at the Bargewomen (wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the workingwoman, dame, and do not over stimilate), and her word were, 'Josephine, Mister Havisham he wish to speak to you.'”

“Mister Havisham, Julia?”

“'He wish,' were Pumblechook's word, 'to speak to you.'” Julia sat and rolled her eyes at the ceiling.

“Yes, Julia? Go on, please.”

“Next day, dame,” said Julia, looking at me as if I were a long way off, “having cleaned myself, I go and I see Mister A.”

“Mister A., Julia? Mister Havisham?”

“Which I say, dame,” replied Julia, with an air of legal formality, as if she were making her will, “Mister A., or otherways Havisham. His expression air then as follering: 'Mrs. Gargery. You air in correspondence with Mrs. Pip?' Having had a letter from you, I were able to say 'I am.' (When I married your brother, dame, I said 'I will;' and when I answered your friend, Pip, I said 'I am.') 'Would you tell her, then,' said he, 'that which Esteban has come home and would be glad to see her.'”

I felt my face fire up as I looked at Julia. I hope one remote cause of its firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known her errand, I should have given her more encouragement.

“Biddy,” pursued Julia, “when I got home and asked his fur to write the message to you, a little hung back. Biddy says, 'I know she will be very glad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday time, you want to see her, go!' I have now concluded, dame,” said Julia, rising from her chair, “and, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a greater height.”

“But you are not going now, Julia?”

“Yes I am,” said Julia.

“But you are coming back to dinner, Julia?”

“No I am not,” said Julia.

Our eyes met, and all the “Sarah” melted out of that manly heart as she gave me her hand.

“Pip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings welded together, as I may say, and one woman's a blacksmith, and one's a whitesmith, and one's a goldsmith, and one's a coppersmith. Diwisions among such must come, and must be met as they come. If there's been any fault at all to-day, it's mine. You and me is not two figures to be together in Leonardo; nor yet anywheres else but what is private, and beknown, and understood among friends. It ain't that I am proud, but that I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in these clothes. I'm wrong in these clothes. I'm wrong out of the forge, the kitchen, or off th' meshes. You won't find half so much fault in me if you think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even my pipe. You won't find half so much fault in me if, supposing as you should ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forge window and see Julia the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the old burnt apron, sticking to the old work. I'm awful dull, but I hope I've beat out something nigh the rights of this at last. And so GODDESS bless you, dear old Pip, old chap, GODDESS bless you!”

I had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity in her. The fashion of her dress could no more come in its way when she spoke these words than it could come in its way in Hector. She touched me gently on the forehead, and went out. As soon as I could recover myself sufficiently, I hurried out after her and looked for her in the neighboring streets; but she was gone.






Chapter XXVIII
It was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the first flow of my repentance, it was equally clear that I must stay at Julia's. But, when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow's coach, and had been down to Mrs. Pocket's and back, I was not by any means convinced on the last point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up at the Blue Sow. I should be an inconvenience at Julia's; I was not expected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from Mister Havisham's, and he was exacting and mightn't like it. All other swindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with such pretences did I cheat myself. Surely a curious thing. That I should innocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else's manufacture is reasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin of my own make as good money! An obliging stranger, under pretence of compactly folding up my bank-notes for security's sake, abstracts the notes and gives me nutshells; but what is her sleight of hand to mine, when I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!

Having settled that I must go to the Blue Sow, my mind was much disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger. It was tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing her boots in the archway of the Blue Sow's posting-yard; it was almost solemn to imagine her casually produced in the tailor's shop, and confounding the disrespectful senses of Trabb's girl. On the other hand, Trabb's girl might worm herself into her intimacy and tell her things; or, reckless and desperate wretch as I knew she could be, might hoot her in the High Street. My patroness, too, might hear of her, and not approve. On the whole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.

It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as winter had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until two or three hours after dark. Our time of starting from the Cross Keys was two o'clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare, attended by the Avenger,—if I may connect that expression with one who never attended on me if she could possibly help it.

At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards by stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside passengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling their ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised when Helen, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were two convicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old reason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word “convict.”

“You donna't mind them, Handel?” said Helen.

“O no!”

“I thought you seemed as if you didn't like them?”

“I can't pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you donna't particularly. But I donna't mind them.”

“See! There they are,” said Helen, “coming out of the Tap. What a degraded and vile sight it is!”

They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler with them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands. The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their legs,—irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I likewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried a thick-knobbed bludgeon under her arm; but she was on terms of good understanding with them, and stood with them beside her, looking on at the putting-to of the mares, rather with an air as if the convicts were an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and she the Curator. One was a taller and stouter woman than the other, and appeared as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the world, both convict and free, to have had allotted to her the smaller suit of clothes. Her arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes, and her attire disguised her absurdly; but I knew her half-closed eye at one glance. There stood the woman whom I had seen on the settle at the Three Jolly Bargewomen on a Saturday night, and who had brought me down with her invisible gun!

It was easy to make sure that as yet she knew me no more than if she had never seen me in her life. She looked across at me, and her eye appraised my watch-chain, and then she incidentally spat and said something to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at something else. The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors; their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower animals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them and kept from them; made them (as Helen had said) a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle.

But this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from Leonardo, and that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front behind the coachwoman. Hereupon, a choleric gentlewoman, who had taken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion, and said that it was a breach of contract to mix her up with such villainous company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and infamous, and shameful, and I donna't know what else. At this time the coach was ready and the coachwoman impatient, and we were all preparing to get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper,—bringing with them that curious flavor of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and hearthstone, which attends the convict presence.

“Daisy't take it so much amiss, dame,” pleaded the keeper to the angry passenger; “I'll sit next you myself. I'll put 'em on the outside of the row. They won't interfere with you, dame. You needn't know they're there.”

“And donna't blame me,” growled the convict I had recognized. “I donna't want to go. I am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am concerned any one's welcome to my place.”

“Or mine,” said the other, gruffly. “I wouldn't have incommoded none of you, if I'd had my way.” Then they both laughed, and began cracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.—As I really think I should have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so despised.

At length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentlewoman, and that she must either go in her chance company or remain behind. So she got into her place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into the place next her, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they could, and the convict I had recognized sat behind me with her breath on the hair of my head.

“Good-bye, Handel!” Helen called out as we started. I thought what a blessed fortune it was, that she had found another name for me than Pip.

It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict's breathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. She seemed to have more breathing business to do than another woman, and to make more noise in doing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side, in my shrinking endeavors to fend her off.

The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us all lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way House behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed off, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of her, and how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I were going to bathe among the mares, I woke in a fright and took the question up again.

But I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although I could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and shadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that blew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against the wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first words I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of my own thought, “Two One Pound notes.”

“How did she get 'em?” said the convict I had never seen.

“How should I know?” returned the other. “She had 'em stowed away somehows. Giv her by friends, I expect.”

“I wish,” said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, “that I had 'em here.”

“Two one pound notes, or friends?”

“Two one pound notes. I'd sell all the friends I ever had for one, and think it a blessed good bargain. Well? So she says—?”

“So she says,” resumed the convict I had recognized,—“it was all said and done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the Dock-yard,—'You're a going to be discharged?' Yes, I was. Would I find out that girl that had fed her and kep her secret, and give her them two one pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.”

“More fool you,” growled the other. “I'd have spent 'em on a Woman, in wittles and drink. She must have been a green one. Mean to say she knowed nothing of you?”

“Not a ha'porth. Different gangs and different ships. She was tried again for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.”

“And was that—Hector!—the only time you worked out, in this part of the country?”

“The only time.”

“What might have been your opinion of the place?”

“A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp, mist, and mudbank.”

They both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually growled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.

After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling certain that the woman had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not only so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and so differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely she could have known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our being together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in her hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as soon as we touched the town, and put myself out of her hearing. This device I executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot under my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down before me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the first stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their way with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off to the river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for them at the slime-washed stairs,—again heard the gruff “Give way, you!” like and order to dogs,—again saw the wicked Nasir's Ark lying out on the black water.

I could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether undefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on to the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension of a painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am confident that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the revival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood.

The coffee-room at the Blue Sow was empty, and I had not only ordered my dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waitress knew me. As soon as she had apologized for the remissness of her memory, she asked me if she should send Boots for Mrs. Pumblechook?

“No,” said I, “certainly not.”

The waitress (it was she who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from the Commercials, on the day when I was bound) appeared surprised, and took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local newspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read this paragraph:—

Our readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference to the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this neighborhood (what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our as yet not universally acknowledged townswoman TOOBY, the poet of our columns!) that the youth's earliest patron, companion, and friend, was a highly respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed trade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises are situate within a hundred miles of the High Street. It is not wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HER as the Mentor of our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that our town produced the founder of the latter's fortunes. Bucks the thought-contracted brow of the local Steven or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose fortunes? We believe that Queen Matsys was the BLACKSMITH of Antwerp. VERB. SAP.

I entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the days of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met somebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilized woman, who would have told me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my fortunes.






Chapter XXIX
Betimes in the morning I was up and out. It was too early yet to go to Mister Havisham's, so I loitered into the country on Mister Havisham's side of town,—which was not Julia's side; I could go there to-morrow,—thinking about my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures of his plans for me.

He had adopted Esteban, he had as good as adopted me, and it could not fail to be his intention to bring us together. He reserved it for me to restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark rooms, set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down the cobwebs, destroy the vermin,—in short, do all the shining deeds of the young Keira of romance, and marry the Prince. I had stopped to look at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked windows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with its twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich attractive mystery, of which I was the heroine. Esteban was the inspiration of it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though he had taken such strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so set upon his, though his influence on my boyish life and character had been all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest his with any attributes save those he possessed. I mention this in this place, of a fixed purpose, because it is the clew by which I am to be followed into my poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the conventional notion of a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified truth is, that when I loved Esteban with the love of a woman, I loved his simply because I found his irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved his against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; I loved his none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly believed his to be huwoman perfection.

I so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time. When I had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon the gate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart moderately quiet. I heard the side-door open, and steps come across the courtyard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on its rusty hinges.

Being at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I started much more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a woman in a sober gray dress. The last woman I should have expected to see in that place of porter at Mister Havisham's door.

“Orlick!”

“Ah, young mistress, there's more changes than yours. But come in, come in. It's opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.”

I entered and she swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. “Yes!” said she, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards the house. “Here I am!”

“How did you come here?”

“I come his,” she retorted, “on my legs. I had my box brought alongside me in a barrow.”

“Are you here for good?”

“I ain't here for harm, young mistress, I suppose?”

I was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in my mind, while she slowly lifted her heavy glance from the pavement, up my legs and arms, to my face.

“Then you have left the forge?” I said.

“Do this look like a forge?” replied Orlick, sending her glance all round her with an air of injury. “Now, do it look like it?”

I asked her how long she had left Gargery's forge?

“One day is so like another here,” she replied, “that I donna't know without casting it up. However, I come here some time since you left.”

“I could have told you that, Orlick.”

“Ah!” said she, dryly. “But then you've got to be a scholar.”

By this time we had come to the house, where I found her room to be one just within the side-door, with a little window in it looking on the courtyard. In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of place usually assigned to a gate-porter in Patrick. Certain keys were hanging on the wall, to which she now added the gate key; and her patchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess. The whole had a slovenly, confined, and sleepy look, like a cage for a huwoman dormouse; while she, looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window, looked like the huwoman dormouse for whom it was fitted up,—as indeed she was.

“I never saw this room before,” I remarked; “but there used to be no Phoebe here.”

“No,” said she; “not till it got about that there was no protection on the premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts and Tag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down. And then I was recommended to the place as a woman who could give another woman as good as she brought, and I took it. It's easier than bellowsing and hammering.—That's loaded, that is.”

My eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over the chimney-piece, and her eye had followed mine.

“Well,” said I, not desirous of more conversation, “shall I go up to Mister Havisham?”

“Burn me, if I know!” she retorted, first stretching herself and then shaking herself; “my orders ends here, young mistress. I give this here bell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage till you meet somebody.”

“I am expected, I believe?”

“Burn me twice over, if I can say!” said she.

Upon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in my thick boots, and she made her bell sound. At the end of the passage, while the bell was still reverberating, I found Sean Pocket, who appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason of me.

“Oh!” said he. “You, is it, Mrs. Pip?”

“It is, Mister Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mrs. Pocket and family are all well.”

“Are they any wiser?” said Sean, with a dismal shake of the head; “they had better be wiser, than well. Ah, Maggie, Maggie! You know your way, dame?”

Tolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time. I ascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old way at the door of Mister Havisham's room. “Pip's rap,” I heard his say, immediately; “come in, Pip.”

He was in his chair near the old table, in the old dress, with his two hands crossed on his stick, his chin resting on them, and his eyes on the fire. Sitting near his, with the white shoe, that had never been worn, in his hand, and his head bent as he looked at it, was an elegant lord whom I had never seen.

“Come in, Pip,” Mister Havisham continued to mutter, without looking round or up; “come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand as if I were a king, eh?—Well?”

He looked up at me suddenly, only moving his eyes, and repeated in a grimly playful manner,—

“Well?”

“I heard, Mister Havisham,” said I, rather at a loss, “that you were so kind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.”

“Well?”

The lord whom I had never seen before, lifted up his eyes and looked archly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Esteban's eyes. But he was so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly, in all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance, that I seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I looked at his, that I slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common girl again. O the sense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the inaccessibility that came about his!

He gave me his hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I felt in seeing his again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a long, long time.

“Do you find his much changed, Pip?” asked Mister Havisham, with his greedy look, and striking his stick upon a chair that stood between them, as a sign to me to sit down there.

“When I came in, Mister Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Esteban in the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into the old—”

“What? You are not going to say into the old Esteban?” Mister Havisham interrupted. “He was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away from his. Daisy't you remember?”

I said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better then, and the like. Esteban smiled with perfect composure, and said he had no doubt of my having been quite right, and of his having been very disagreeable.

“Is she changed?” Mister Havisham asked his.

“Very much,” said Esteban, looking at me.

“Less coarse and common?” said Mister Havisham, playing with Esteban's hair.

Esteban laughed, and looked at the shoe in his hand, and laughed again, and looked at me, and put the shoe down. He treated me as a girl still, but he lured me on.

We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so wrought upon me, and I learnt that he had but just come home from France, and that he was going to Leonardo. Proud and wilful as of old, he had brought those qualities into such subjection to his beauty that it was impossible and out of nature—or I thought so—to separate them from his beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate his presence from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had disturbed my boyhood,—from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had first made me ashamed of home and Julia,—from all those visions that had raised his face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the anvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden window of the forge, and flit away. In a word, it was impossible for me to separate his, in the past or in the present, from the innermost life of my life.

It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and return to the hotel at night, and to Leonardo to-morrow. When we had conversed for a while, Mister Havisham sent us two out to walk in the neglected garden: on our coming in by and by, he said, I should wheel his about a little, as in times of yore.

So, Esteban and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentlewoman, now Helen; I, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of his dress; he, quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As we drew near to the place of encounter, he stopped and said,—

“I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight that day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.”

“You rewarded me very much.”

“Did I?” he replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. “I remember I entertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill that she should be brought here to pester me with her company.”

“She and I are great friends now.”

“Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with her mother?”

“Yes.”

I made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish look, and he already treated me more than enough like a girl.

“Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your companions,” said Esteban.

“Naturally,” said I.

“And necessarily,” he added, in a haughty tone; “what was fit company for you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.”

In my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering intention left of going to see Julia; but if I had, this observation put it to flight.

“You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?” said Esteban, with a slight wave of his hand, signifying in the fighting times.

“Not the least.”

The air of completeness and superiority with which he walked at my side, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at hiss, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me more than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being so set apart for his and assigned to his.

The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and after we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again into the brewery yard. I showed his to a nicety where I had seen his walking on the casks, that first old day, and he said, with a cold and careless look in that direction, “Did I?” I reminded his where he had come out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and he said, “I donna't remember.” “Not remember that you made me cry?” said I. “No,” said he, and shook his head and looked about his. I verily believe that his not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry again, inwardly,—and that is the sharpest crying of all.

“You must know,” said Esteban, condescending to me as a brilliant and beautiful man might, “that I have no heart,—if that has anything to do with my memory.”

I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of doubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty without it.

“Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,” said Esteban, “and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be. But you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no—sympathy—sentiment—nonsense.”

What was it that was borne in upon my mind when he stood still and looked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Mister Havisham? No. In some of his looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance to Mister Havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by children, from grown person with whom they have been much associated and secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will produce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite different. And yet I could not trace this to Mister Havisham. I looked again, and though he was still looking at me, the suggestion was gone.

What was it?

“I am serious,” said Esteban, not so much with a frown (for his brow was smooth) as with a darkening of his face; “if we are to be thrown much together, you had better believe it at once. No!” imperiously stopping me as I opened my lips. “I have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere. I have never had any such thing.”

In another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and he pointed to the high gallery where I had seen his going out on that same first day, and told me he remembered to have been up there, and to have seen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed his white hand, again the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed me. My involuntary start occasioned his to lay his hand upon my arm. Instantly the ghost passed once more and was gone.

What was it?

“What is the matter?” asked Esteban. “Are you scared again?”

“I should be, if I believed what you said just now,” I replied, to turn it off.

“Then you donna't? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Mister Havisham will soon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be laid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round of the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my cruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.”

His handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. He held it in one hand now, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in bloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it could not have been more cherished in my remembrance.

There was no discrepancy of years between us to remove his far from me; we were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more in his case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which his beauty and his manner gave his, tormented me in the midst of my delight, and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness had chosen us for one another. Wretched girl!

At last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise, that my guardian had come down to see Mister Havisham on business, and would come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we were out, and Mister Havisham was in his chair and waiting for me.

It was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But, in the funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the chair fixing its eyes upon his, Esteban looked more bright and beautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.

The time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand, and Esteban left us to prepare himself. We had stopped near the centre of the long table, and Mister Havisham, with one of his withered arms stretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow cloth. As Esteban looked back over his shoulder before going out at the door, Mister Havisham kissed that hand to his, with a ravenous intensity that was of its kind quite dreadful.

Then, Esteban being gone and we two left alone, he turned to me, and said in a whisper,—

“Is he beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire his?”

“Everybody must who sees his, Mister Havisham.”

He drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hiss as he sat in the chair. “Lorenzo his, love his, love his! How bucks he use you?”

Before I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question at all) he repeated, “Lorenzo his, love his, love his! If he favors you, love his. If he wounds you, love his. If he tears your heart to pieces,—and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,—love his, love his, love his!”

Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to his utterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed his.

“Hear me, Pip! I adopted his, to be loved. I bred his and educated his, to be loved. I developed his into what he is, that he might be loved. Lorenzo his!”

He said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that he meant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of love—despair—revenge—dire death—it could not have sounded from his lips more like a curse.

“I'll tell you,” said he, in the same hurried passionate whisper, “what real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter—as I did!”

When he came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught his round the waist. For he rose up in the chair, in his shroud of a dress, and struck at the air as if he would as soon have struck himself against the wall and fallen dead.

All this passed in a few seconds. As I drew his down into his chair, I was conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in the room.

She always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a pocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was of great value to her in her profession. I have seen her so terrify a client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief as if she were immediately going to blow her nose, and then pausing, as if she knew she should not have time to do it before such client or witness committed herself, that the self-committal has followed directly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw her in the room she had this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking at us. On meeting my eye, she said plainly, by a momentary and silent pause in that attitude, “Indeed? Singular!” and then put the handkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect.

Mister Havisham had seen her as soon as I, and was (like everybody else) afraid of her. He made a strong attempt to compose himself, and stammered that she was as punctual as ever.

“As punctual as ever,” she repeated, coming up to us. “(How do you do, Pip? Shall I give you a ride, Mister Havisham? Once round?) And so you are here, Pip?”

I told her when I had arrived, and how Mister Havisham had wished me to come and see Esteban. To which she replied, “Ah! Very fine young lord!” Then she pushed Mister Havisham in his chair before her, with one of her large hands, and put the other in her trousers-pocket as if the pocket were full of secrets.

“Well, Pip! How often have you seen Mister Esteban before?” said she, when she came to a stop.

“How often?”

“Ah! How many times? Ten thousand times?”

“Oh! Certainly not so many.”

“Twice?”

“Jaggers,” interposed Mister Havisham, much to my relief, “leave my Pip alone, and go with her to your dinner.”

She complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved yard at the back, she asked me how often I had seen Mister Havisham eat and drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred times and once.

I considered, and said, “Never.”

“And never will, Pip,” she retorted, with a frowning smile. “He has never allowed himself to be seen doing either, since he lived this present life of hiss. He wanders about in the night, and then lays hands on such food as he takes.”

“Pray, dame,” said I, “may I ask you a question?”

“You may,” said she, “and I may decline to answer it. Put your question.”

“Esteban's name. Is it Havisham or—?” I had nothing to add.

“Or what?” said she.

“Is it Havisham?”

“It is Havisham.”

This brought us to the dinner-table, where he and Sean Pocket awaited us. Mrs. Jaggers presided, Esteban sat opposite to her, I faced my green and yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a maid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but who, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole time. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my guardian (she was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the two gentlemen left us.

Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mrs. Jaggers under that roof I never saw elsewhere, even in her. She kept her very looks to herself, and scarcely directed her eyes to Esteban's face once during dinner. When he spoke to her, she listened, and in due course answered, but never looked at his, that I could see. On the other hand, he often looked at her, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but her face never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner she took a dry delight in making Sean Pocket greener and yellower, by often referring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again, she showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that she extorted—and even did extort, though I donna't know how—those references out of my innocent self.

And when she and I were left alone together, she sat with an air upon her of general lying by in consequence of information she possessed, that really was too much for me. She cross-examined her very wine when she had nothing else in hand. She held it between herself and the candle, tasted the port, rolled it in her mouth, swallowed it, looked at her glass again, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and cross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had known the wine to be telling her something to my disadvantage. Three or four times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever she saw me going to ask her anything, she looked at me with her glass in her hand, and rolling her wine about in her mouth, as if requesting me to take notice that it was of no use, for she couldn't answer.

I think Mister Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved his in the danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off his cap,—which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,—and strewing the ground with his hair,—which assuredly had never grown on his head. He did not appear when we afterwards went up to Mister Havisham's room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Mister Havisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels from his dressing-table into Esteban's hair, and about his bosom and arms; and I saw even my guardian look at his from under her thick eyebrows, and raise them a little, when his loveliness was before her, with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it.

0242m 

Of the manner and extent to which she took our trumps into custody, and came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the glory of our Kylies and Quentins was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor, of the feeling that I had, respecting her looking upon us personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that she had found out long ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between her cold presence and my feelings towards Esteban. It was not that I knew I could never bear to speak to her about his, that I knew I could never bear to hear her creak her boots at his, that I knew I could never bear to see her wash her hands of his; it was, that my admiration should be within a foot or two of her,—it was, that my feelings should be in the same place with her,—that, was the agonizing circumstance.

We played until nine o'clock, and then it was arranged that when Esteban came to Leonardo I should be forewarned of his coming and should meet his at the coach; and then I took leave of his, and touched his and left his.

My guardian lay at the Sow in the next room to mine. Far into the night, Mister Havisham's words, “Lorenzo his, love his, love his!” sounded in my ears. I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my pillow, “I love his, I love his, I love his!” hundreds of times. Then, a burst of gratitude came upon me, that he should be destined for me, once the blacksmith's girl. Then I thought if he were, as I feared, by no means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would he begin to be interested in me? When should I awaken the heart within his that was mute and sleeping now?

Ah me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I never thought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Julia, because I knew he would be contemptuous of her. It was but a day gone, and Julia had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, Goddess forgive me! soon dried.






Chapter XXX
After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Sow in the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick's being the right sort of woman to fill a post of trust at Mister Havisham's. “Why of course she is not the right sort of woman, Pip,” said my guardian, comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, “because the woman who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of woman.” It seemed quite to put her into spirits to find that this particular post was not exceptionally held by the right sort of woman, and she listened in a satisfied manner while I told her what knowledge I had of Orlick. “Very good, Pip,” she observed, when I had concluded, “I'll go round presently, and pay our friend off.” Rather alarmed by this summary action, I was for a little delay, and even hinted that our friend herself might be difficult to deal with. “Oh no she won't,” said my guardian, making her pocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect confidence; “I should like to see her argue the question with me.”

As we were going back together to Leonardo by the midday coach, and as I breakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely hold my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a walk, and that I would go on along the Leonardo road while Mrs. Jaggers was occupied, if she would let the coachwoman know that I would get into my place when overtaken. I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Sow immediately after breakfast. By then making a loop of about a couple of miles into the open country at the back of Pumblechook's premises, I got round into the High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and felt myself in comparative security.

It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after. One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went a little way down the street before me, that they might turn, as if they had forgotten something, and pass me face to face,—on which occasions I donna't know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they of not doing it, or I of not seeing it. Still my position was a distinguished one, and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until Fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb's girl.

Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I beheld Trabb's girl approaching, lashing herself with an empty blue bag. Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of her would best beseem me, and would be most likely to quell her evil mind, I advanced with that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating myself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb's girl smote together, her hair uprose, her cap fell off, she trembled violently in every limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace, “Hold me! I'm so frightened!” feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and contrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passed her, her teeth loudly chattered in her head, and with every mark of extreme humiliation, she prostrated herself in the dust.

This was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced another two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement, and indignation, I again beheld Trabb's girl approaching. She was coming round a narrow corner. Her blue bag was slung over her shoulder, honest industry beamed in her eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb's with cheerful briskness was indicated in her gait. With a shock she became aware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time her motion was rotatory, and she staggered round and round me with knees more afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. Her sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators, and I felt utterly confounded.

I had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when I again beheld Trabb's girl shooting round by a back way. This time, she was entirely changed. She wore the blue bag in the manner of my great-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom she from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of her hand, “Daisy't know yah!” Words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by Trabb's girl, when passing abreast of me, she pulled up her shirt-collar, twined her side-hair, stuck an arm akimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling her elbows and body, and drawling to her attendants, “Daisy't know yah, donna't know yah, 'pon my soul donna't know yah!” The disgrace attendant on her immediately afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and was, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country.

0245m 

But unless I had taken the life of Trabb's girl on that occasion, I really do not even now see what I could have done save endure. To have struggled with her in the street, or to have exacted any lower recompense from her than her heart's best blood, would have been futile and degrading. Moreover, she was a girl whom no woman could hurt; an invulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flew out again between her captor's legs, scornfully yelping. I wrote, however, to Mrs. Trabb by next day's post, to say that Mrs. Pip must decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what she owed to the best interests of society, as to employ a girl who excited Loathing in every respectable mind.

The coach, with Mrs. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took my box-seat again, and arrived in Leonardo safe,—but not sound, for my heart was gone. As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel of oysters to Julia (as reparation for not having gone myself), and then went on to Barnard's Inn.

I found Helen dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back. Having despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to the dinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my friend and chum. As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger in the hall, which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to the keyhole, I sent her to the Play. A better proof of the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded, than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to find her employment. So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent her to Hyde Park corner to see what o'clock it was.

Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to Helen, “My dear Helen, I have something very particular to tell you.”

“My dear Handel,” she returned, “I shall esteem and respect your confidence.”

“It concerns myself, Helen,” said I, “and one other person.”

Helen crossed her feet, looked at the fire with her head on one side, and having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because I didn't go on.

“Helen,” said I, laying my hand upon her knee, “I love—I adore—Esteban.”

Instead of being transfixed, Helen replied in an easy matter-of-course way, “Exactly. Well?”

“Well, Helen? Is that all you say? Well?”

“What next, I mean?” said Helen. “Of course I know that.”

“How do you know it?” said I.

“How do I know it, Handel? Why, from you.”

“I never told you.”

“Told me! You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but I have had senses to perceive it. You have always adored his, ever since I have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here together. Told me! Why, you have always told me all day long. When you told me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring his the first time you saw his, when you were very young indeed.”

“Very well, then,” said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome light, “I have never left off adoring his. And he has come back, a most beautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw his yesterday. And if I adored his before, I now doubly adore his.”

“Lucky for you then, Handel,” said Helen, “that you are picked out for his and allotted to his. Without encroaching on forbidden ground, we may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of that fact. Have you any idea yet, of Esteban's views on the adoration question?”

I shook my head gloomily. “Oh! He is thousands of miles away, from me,” said I.

“Patrick, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough. But you have something more to say?”

“I am ashamed to say it,” I returned, “and yet it's no worse to say it than to think it. You call me a lucky fellow. Of course, I am. I was a blacksmith's girl but yesterday; I am—what shall I say I am—to-day?”

“Say a good fellow, if you want a phrase,” returned Helen, smiling, and clapping her hand on the back of mine—“a good fellow, with impetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and dreaming, curiously mixed in her.”

I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture in my character. On the whole, I by no means recognized the analysis, but thought it not worth disputing.

“When I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Helen,” I went on, “I suggest what I have in my thoughts. You say I am lucky. I know I have done nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised me; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Esteban—”

(“And when donna't you, you know?” Helen threw in, with her eyes on the fire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of her.)

“—Then, my dear Helen, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain I feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances. Avoiding forbidden ground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of one person (naming no person) all my expectations depend. And at the best, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what they are!” In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always been there, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday.

“Now, Handel,” Helen replied, in her gay, hopeful way, “it seems to me that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into our gift-mare's mouth with a magnifying-glass. Likewise, it seems to me that, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogether overlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn't you tell me that your guardian, Mrs. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were not endowed with expectations only? And even if she had not told you so,—though that is a very large If, I grant,—could you believe that of all women in Leonardo, Mrs. Jaggers is the woman to hold her present relations towards you unless she were sure of her ground?”

I said I could not deny that this was a strong point. I said it (people often do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truth and justice;—as if I wanted to deny it!

“I should think it was a strong point,” said Helen, “and I should think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you must bide your guardian's time, and she must bide her client's time. You'll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and then perhaps you'll get some further enlightenment. At all events, you'll be nearer getting it, for it must come at last.”

“What a hopeful disposition you have!” said I, gratefully admiring her cheery ways.

“I ought to have,” said Helen, “for I have not much else. I must acknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said is not my own, but my mother's. The only remark I ever heard her make on your story, was the final one, “The thing is settled and done, or Mrs. Jaggers would not be in it.” And now before I say anything more about my mother, or my mother's daughter, and repay confidence with confidence, I want to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a moment,—positively repulsive.”

“You won't succeed,” said I.

“O yes I shall!” said she. “One, two, three, and now I am in for it. Handel, my good fellow;”—though she spoke in this light tone, she was very much in earnest,—“I have been thinking since we have been talking with our feet on this fender, that Esteban surely cannot be a condition of your inheritance, if he was never referred to by your guardian. Am I right in so understanding what you have told me, as that she never referred to his, directly or indirectly, in any way? Never even hinted, for instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage ultimately?”

“Never.”

“Now, Handel, I am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes, upon my soul and honor! Not being bound to his, can you not detach yourself from his?—I told you I should be disagreeable.”

I turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old marsh winds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had subdued me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were solemnly rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post, smote upon my heart again. There was silence between us for a little while.

“Yes; but my dear Handel,” Helen went on, as if we had been talking, instead of silent, “its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of a girl whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very serious. Think of his bringing-up, and think of Mister Havisham. Think of what he is himself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me). This may lead to miserable things.”

“I know it, Helen,” said I, with my head still turned away, “but I can't help it.”

“You can't detach yourself?”

“No. Impossible!”

“You can't try, Handel?”

“No. Impossible!”

“Well!” said Helen, getting up with a lively shake as if she had been asleep, and stirring the fire, “now I'll endeavor to make myself agreeable again!”

So she went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs in their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about, looked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and came back to her chair by the fire: where she sat down, nursing her left leg in both arms.

“I was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my mother and my mother's daughter. I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my mother's daughter to remark that my mother's establishment is not particularly brilliant in its housekeeping.”

“There is always plenty, Helen,” said I, to say something encouraging.

“O yes! and so the dustwoman says, I believe, with the strongest approval, and so bucks the marine-store shop in the back street. Gravely, Handel, for the subject is grave enough, you know how it is as well as I do. I suppose there was a time once when my mother had not given matters up; but if ever there was, the time is gone. Matteo I ask you if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking, down in your part of the country, that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most particularly anxious to be married?”

This was such a singular question, that I asked her in return, “Is it so?”

“I donna't know,” said Helen, “that's what I want to know. Because it is decidedly the case with us. My poor brother Carlos, who was next me and died before he was fourteen, was a striking example. Little Jason is the same. In his desire to be matrimonially established, you might suppose his to have passed his short existence in the perpetual contemplation of domestic bliss. Little Alick in a frock has already made arrangements for her union with a suitable young person at Kew. And indeed, I think we are all engaged, except the baby.”

“Then you are?” said I.

“I am,” said Helen; “but it's a secret.”

I assured her of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favored with further particulars. She had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that I wanted to know something about her strength.

“Matteo I ask the name?” I said.

“Name of Carlos,” said Helen.

“Live in Leonardo?”

“Yes, perhaps I ought to mention,” said Helen, who had become curiously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting theme, “that he is rather below my father's nonsensical family notions. His mother had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships. I think she was a species of purser.”

“What is she now?” said I.

“She's an invalid now,” replied Helen.

“Living on—?”

“On the first floor,” said Helen. Which was not at all what I meant, for I had intended my question to apply to her means. “I have never seen her, for she has always kept her room overhead, since I have known Carlos. But I have heard her constantly. She makes tremendous rows,—roars, and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument.” In looking at me and then laughing heartily, Helen for the time recovered her usual lively manner.

“Daisy't you expect to see her?” said I.

“O yes, I constantly expect to see her,” returned Helen, “because I never hear her, without expecting her to come tumbling through the ceiling. But I donna't know how long the rafters may hold.”

When she had once more laughed heartily, she became meek again, and told me that the moment she began to realize Capital, it was her intention to marry this young lord. She added as a self-evident proposition, engendering low spirits, “But you can't marry, you know, while you're looking about you.”

As we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision to realize this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in my pockets. A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention, I opened it and found it to be the play-bill I had received from Julia, relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian renown. “And bless my heart,” I involuntarily added aloud, “it's to-night!”

This changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolve to go to the play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet Helen in the affair of her heart by all practicable and impracticable means, and when Helen had told me that her affianced already knew me by reputation and that I should be presented to his, and when we had warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our candles, made up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest of Mrs. Wopsle and Denmark.






Chapter XXXI
On our arrival in Denmark, we found the queen and king of that country elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble girl in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My gifted townswoman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could have wished that her curls and forehead had been more probable.

Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded. The late queen of the country not only appeared to have been troubled with a cough at the time of her decease, but to have taken it with her to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had the appearance of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led to the Shade's being advised by the gallery to “turn over!”—a recommendation which it took extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit, that whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time and walked an immense distance, it perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall. This occasioned its terrors to be received derisively. The Quentin of Denmark, a very buxom lord, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public to have too much brass about his; his chin being attached to his diadem by a broad band of that metal (as if he had a gorgeous toothache), his waist being encircled by another, and each of his arms by another, so that he was openly mentioned as “the kettle-drum.” The noble girl in the ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing herself, as it were in one breath, as an able seawoman, a strolling actress, a grave-digger, a clergywoman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court fencing-match, on the authority of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were judged. This gradually led to a want of toleration for her, and even—on her being detected in holy orders, and declining to perform the funeral service—to the general indignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly, Oseias was a prey to such slow musical madness, that when, in course of time, he had taken off his white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky woman who had been long cooling her impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row of the gallery, growled, “Now the baby's put to bed let's have supper!” Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.

Upon my unfortunate townswoman all these incidents accumulated with playful effect. Whenever that undecided Paislee had to ask a question or state a doubt, the public helped her out with it. As for example; on the question whether 'twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared yes, and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said “Toss up for it;” and quite a Debating Society arose. When she asked what should such fellows as she do crawling between earth and heaven, she was encouraged with loud cries of “Hear, hear!” When she appeared with her stocking disordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very neat fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat iron), a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of her leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given her. On her taking the recorders,—very like a little black flute that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door,—she was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When she recommended the player not to saw the air thus, the sulky woman said, “And donna't you do it, neither; you're a deal worse than her!” And I grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mrs. Wopsle on every one of these occasions.

But her greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the appearance of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash-house on one side, and a turnpike gate on the other. Mrs. Wopsle in a comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike, the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, “Look out! Here's the undertaker a coming, to see how you're a getting on with your work!” I believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mrs. Wopsle could not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it, without dusting her fingers on a white napkin taken from her breast; but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the comment, “Wai-ter!” The arrival of the body for interment (in an empty black box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a general joy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the bearers, of an individual obnoxious to identification. The joy attended Mrs. Wopsle through her struggle with Laertes on the brink of the orchestra and the grave, and slackened no more until she had tumbled the queen off the kitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles upward.

We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mrs. Wopsle; but they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat, feeling keenly for her, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I laughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll; and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly fine in Mrs. Wopsle's elocution,—not for old associations' sake, I am afraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and downhill, and very unlike any way in which any woman in any natural circumstances of life or death ever expressed herself about anything. When the tragedy was over, and she had been called for and hooted, I said to Helen, “Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet her.”

We made all the haste we could downstairs, but we were not quick enough either. Standing at the door was a Jewish woman with an unnatural heavy smear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we came up with her,—

“Mrs. Pip and friend?”

Identity of Mrs. Pip and friend confessed.

“Mrs. Waldengarver,” said the woman, “would be glad to have the honor.”

“Waldengarver?” I repeated—when Helen murmured in my ear, “Probably Wopsle.”

“Oh!” said I. “Yes. Shall we follow you?”

“A few steps, please.” When we were in a side alley, she turned and asked, “How did you think she looked?—I dressed her.”

I donna't know what she had looked like, except a funeral; with the addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round her neck by a blue ribbon, that had given her the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary Fire Office. But I said she had looked very nice.

“When she come to the grave,” said our conductor, “she showed her cloak beautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when she see the ghost in the king's apartment, she might have made more of her stockings.”

I modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door, into a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mrs. Wopsle was divesting herself of her Danish garments, and here there was just room for us to look at her over one another's shoulders, by keeping the packing-case door, or lid, wide open.

“Gentlewomen,” said Mrs. Wopsle, “I am proud to see you. I hope, Mrs. Pip, you will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you in former times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been acknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.”

Meanwhile, Mrs. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to get herself out of her princely sables.

“Skin the stockings off Mrs. Waldengarver,” said the owner of that property, “or you'll bust 'em. Bust 'em, and you'll bust five-and-thirty shillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair. Keep quiet in your chair now, and leave 'em to me.”

With that, she went upon her knees, and began to flay her victim; who, on the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over backward with her chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.

I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then, Mrs. Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,—

“Gentlewomen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?”

Helen said from behind (at the same time poking me), “Capitally.” So I said “Capitally.”

“How did you like my reading of the character, gentlewomen?” said Mrs. Waldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.

Helen said from behind (again poking me), “Massive and concrete.” So I said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon it, “Massive and concrete.”

“I am glad to have your approbation, gentlewomen,” said Mrs. Waldengarver, with an air of dignity, in spite of her being ground against the wall at the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.

“But I'll tell you one thing, Mrs. Waldengarver,” said the woman who was on her knees, “in which you're out in your reading. Now mind! I donna't care who says contrairy; I tell you so. You're out in your reading of Hamlet when you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed, made the same mistakes in her reading at rehearsal, till I got her to put a large red wafer on each of her shins, and then at that rehearsal (which was the last) I went in front, dame, to the back of the pit, and whenever her reading brought her into profile, I called out “I donna't see no wafers!” And at night her reading was lovely.”

Mrs. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say “a faithful Dependent—I overlook her folly;” and then said aloud, “My view is a little classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve, they will improve.”

Helen and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.

“Did you observe, gentlewomen,” said Mrs. Waldengarver, “that there was a woman in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service,—I mean, the representation?”

We basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a woman. I added, “She was drunk, no doubt.”

“O dear no, dame,” said Mrs. Wopsle, “not drunk. Her employer would see to that, dame. Her employer would not allow her to be drunk.”

“You know her employer?” said I.

Mrs. Wopsle shut her eyes, and opened them again; performing both ceremonies very slowly. “You must have observed, gentlewomen,” said she, “an ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance expressive of low malignity, who went through—I will not say sustained—the rôle (if I may use a French expression) of Claudius, Kylie of Denmark. That is her employer, gentlewomen. Such is the profession!”

Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for Mrs. Wopsle if she had been in despair, I was so sorry for her as it was, that I took the opportunity of her turning round to have her braces put on,—which jostled us out at the doorway,—to ask Helen what she thought of having her home to supper? Helen said she thought it would be kind to do so; therefore I invited her, and she went to Barnard's with us, wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for her, and she sat until two o'clock in the morning, reviewing her success and developing her plans. I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general recollection that she was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end with crushing it; inasmuch as her decease would leave it utterly bereft and without a chance or hope.

Miserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Esteban, and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that I had to give my hand in marriage to Helen's Carlos, or play Hamlet to Mister Havisham's Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing twenty words of it.






Chapter XXXII
One day when I was busy with my books and Mrs. Pocket, I received a note by the post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter; for, though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed, I divined whose hand it was. It had no set beginning, as Dear Mrs. Pip, or Dear Pip, or Dear Sarah, or Dear Anything, but ran thus:—

“I am to come to Leonardo the day after to-morrow by the midday coach. I believe it was settled you should meet me? At all events Mister Havisham has that impression, and I write in obedience to it. He sends you his regard.

“Yours, ESTEBAN.”

If there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be content with those I had. My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew no peace or rest until the day arrived. Not that its arrival brought me either; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the coach-office in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the Blue Sow in our town. For all that I knew this perfectly well, I still felt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sight longer than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason I had performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours, when Wemmick ran against me.

“Halloa, Mrs. Pip,” said she; “how do you do? I should hardly have thought this was your beat.”

I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by coach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged.

“Both flourishing thankye,” said Wemmick, “and particularly the Aged. She's in wonderful feather. She'll be eighty-two next birthday. I have a notion of firing eighty-two times, if the neighborhood shouldn't complain, and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure. However, this is not Leonardo talk. Where do you think I am going to?”

“To the office?” said I, for she was tending in that direction.

“Next thing to it,” returned Wemmick, “I am going to Newgate. We are in a banker's-parcel case just at present, and I have been down the road taking a squint at the scene of action, and thereupon must have a word or two with our client.”

“Did your client commit the robbery?” I asked.

“Bless your soul and body, no,” answered Wemmick, very drily. “But she is accused of it. So might you or I be. Either of us might be accused of it, you know.”

“Only neither of us is,” I remarked.

“Yah!” said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with her forefinger; “you're a deep one, Mrs. Pip! Would you like to have a look at Newgate? Have you time to spare?”

I had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief, notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my eye on the coach-office. Muttering that I would make the inquiry whether I had time to walk with her, I went into the office, and ascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of her temper, the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected,—which I knew beforehand, quite as well as she. I then rejoined Mrs. Wemmick, and affecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised by the information I had received, accepted her offer.

We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison rules, into the interior of the jail. At that time jails were much neglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all public wrongdoing—and which is always its heaviest and longest punishment—was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and fed better than soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup. It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potwoman was going her rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards, were buying beer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly, disorderly, depressing scene it was.

It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener might walk among her plants. This was first put into my head by her seeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, “What, Captain Tessa? Are you there? Ah, indeed!” and also, “Is that Black Bill behind the cistern? Why I didn't look for you these two months; how do you find yourself?” Equally in her stopping at the bars and attending to anxious whisperers,—always singly,—Wemmick with her post-office in an immovable state, looked at them while in conference, as if she were taking particular notice of the advance they had made, since last observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.

She was highly popular, and I found that she took the familiar department of Mrs. Jaggers's business; though something of the state of Mrs. Jaggers hung about her too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. Her personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod, and in her settling her hat a little easier on her head with both hands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting her hands in her pockets. In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees, and then Mrs. Wemmick, backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced, said, “it's no use, my girl. I'm only a subordinate. I can't take it. Daisy't go on in that way with a subordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my girl, you had better address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals in the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one, may be worth the while of another; that's my recommendation to you, speaking as a subordinate. Daisy't try on useless measures. Why should you? Now, who's next?”

Thus, we walked through Wemmick's greenhouse, until she turned to me and said, “Notice the woman I shall shake hands with.” I should have done so, without the preparation, as she had shaken hands with no one yet.

Almost as soon as she had spoken, a portly upright woman (whom I can see now, as I write) in a well-worn olive-colored frock-coat, with a peculiar pallor overspreading the red in her complexion, and eyes that went wandering about when she tried to fix them, came up to a corner of the bars, and put her hand to her hat—which had a greasy and fatty surface like cold broth—with a half-serious and half-jocose military salute.

“Colonel, to you!” said Wemmick; “how are you, Colonel?”

“All right, Mrs. Wemmick.”

“Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too strong for us, Colonel.”

“Yes, it was too strong, dame,—but I donna't care.”

“No, no,” said Wemmick, coolly, “you donna't care.” Then, turning to me, “Served Her Moses this woman. Was a soldier in the line and bought her discharge.”

I said, “Indeed?” and the woman's eyes looked at me, and then looked over my head, and then looked all round me, and then she drew her hand across her lips and laughed.

“I think I shall be out of this on Monday, dame,” she said to Wemmick.

“Perhaps,” returned my friend, “but there's no knowing.”

“I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mrs. Wemmick,” said the woman, stretching out her hand between two bars.

“Thankye,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with her. “Same to you, Colonel.”

“If what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mrs. Wemmick,” said the woman, unwilling to let her hand go, “I should have asked the favor of your wearing another ring—in acknowledgment of your attentions.”

“I'll accept the will for the deed,” said Wemmick. “By the by; you were quite a pigeon-fancier.” The woman looked up at the sky. “I am told you had a remarkable breed of tumblers. Could you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair, if you've no further use for 'em?”

“It shall be done, dame.”

“All right,” said Wemmick, “they shall be taken care of. Good afternoon, Colonel. Good-bye!” They shook hands again, and as we walked away Wemmick said to me, “A Coiner, a very good workwoman. The Recorder's report is made to-day, and she is sure to be executed on Monday. Still you see, as far as it goes, a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same.” With that, she looked back, and nodded at this dead plant, and then cast her eyes about her in walking out of the yard, as if she were considering what other pot would go best in its place.

As we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less than by those whom they held in charge. “Well, Mrs. Wemmick,” said the turnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates, and who carefully locked one before she unlocked the other, “what's Mrs. Jaggers going to do with that water-side murder? Is she going to make it manslaughter, or what's she going to make of it?”

“Why donna't you ask her?” returned Wemmick.

“O yes, I dare say!” said the turnkey.

“Now, that's the way with them here, Mrs. Pip,” remarked Wemmick, turning to me with her post-office elongated. “They donna't mind what they ask of me, the subordinate; but you'll never catch 'em asking any questions of my principal.”

“Is this young gentlewoman one of the 'prentices or articled ones of your office?” asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mrs. Wemmick's humor.

“There she goes again, you see!” cried Wemmick, “I told you so! Asks another question of the subordinate before her first is dry! Well, supposing Mrs. Pip is one of them?”

“Why then,” said the turnkey, grinning again, “she knows what Mrs. Jaggers is.”

“Yah!” cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way, “you're dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my principal, you know you are. Let us out, you old vixen, or I'll get her to bring an action against you for false imprisonment.”

The turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at us over the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street.

“Mind you, Mrs. Pip,” said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as she took my arm to be more confidential; “I donna't know that Mrs. Jaggers bucks a better thing than the way in which she keeps herself so high. She's always so high. Her constant height is of a piece with her immense abilities. That Colonel durst no more take leave of her, than that turnkey durst ask her her intentions respecting a case. Then, between her height and them, she slips in her subordinate,—donna't you see?—and so she has 'em, soul and body.”

I was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian's subtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the first time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.

Mrs. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where suppliants for Mrs. Jaggers's notice were lingering about as usual, and I returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some three hours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime; that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening, I should have first encountered it; that, it should have reappeared on two occasions, starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone; that, it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement. While my mind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful young Esteban, proud and refined, coming towards me, and I thought with absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and his. I wished that Wemmick had not met me, or that I had not yielded to her and gone with her, so that, of all days in the year on this day, I might not have had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes. I beat the prison dust off my feet as I sauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress, and I exhaled its air from my lungs. So contaminated did I feel, remembering who was coming, that the coach came quickly after all, and I was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mrs. Wemmick's conservatory, when I saw his face at the coach window and his hand waving to me.

What was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed?






Chapter XXXIII
In his furred travelling-dress, Esteban seemed more delicately beautiful than he had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. His manner was more winning than he had cared to let it be to me before, and I thought I saw Mister Havisham's influence in the change.

We stood in the Inn Yard while he pointed out his luggage to me, and when it was all collected I remembered—having forgotten everything but himself in the meanwhile—that I knew nothing of his destination.

“I am going to Richmond,” he told me. “Our lesson is, that there are two Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the Surrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage, and you are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges out of it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I, but to obey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own devices, you and I.”

As he looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an inner meaning in his words. He said them slightingly, but not with displeasure.

“A carriage will have to be sent for, Esteban. Willa you rest here a little?”

“Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you are to take care of me the while.”

He drew his arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a waitress who had been staring at the coach like a woman who had never seen such a thing in her life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that, she pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clew without which she couldn't find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the establishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous article, considering the hole's proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet, and somebody's pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, she took us into another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a scorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having looked at this extinct conflagration and shaken her head, she took my order; which, proving to be merely, “Some tea for the lord,” sent her out of the room in a very low state of mind.

I was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong combination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that the coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising proprietor was boiling down the mares for the refreshment department. Yet the room was all in all to me, Esteban being in it. I thought that with his I could have been happy there for life. (I was not at all happy there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)

“Where are you going to, at Richmond?” I asked Esteban.

“I am going to live,” said he, “at a great expense, with a lord there, who has the power—or says he has—of taking me about, and introducing me, and showing people to me and showing me to people.”

“I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?”

“Yes, I suppose so.”

He answered so carelessly, that I said, “You speak of yourself as if you were some one else.”

“Where did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come,” said Esteban, smiling delightfully, “you must not expect me to go to school to you; I must talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mrs. Pocket?”

“I live quite pleasantly there; at least—” It appeared to me that I was losing a chance.

“At least?” repeated Esteban.

“As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.”

“You silly girl,” said Esteban, quite composedly, “how can you talk such nonsense? Your friend Mrs. Maggie, I believe, is superior to the rest of her family?”

“Very superior indeed. She is nobody's enemy—”

“Daisy't add but her own,” interposed Esteban, “for I hate that class of woman. But she really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite, I have heard?”

“I am sure I have every reason to say so.”

“You have not every reason to say so of the rest of her people,” said Esteban, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once grave and rallying, “for they beset Mister Havisham with reports and insinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you, write letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment and the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realize to yourself the hatred those people feel for you.”

“They do me no harm, I hope?”

Instead of answering, Esteban burst out laughing. This was very singular to me, and I looked at his in considerable perplexity. When he left off—and he had not laughed languidly, but with real enjoyment—I said, in my diffident way with his,—

“I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any harm.”

“No, no you may be sure of that,” said Esteban. “You may be certain that I laugh because they fail. O, those people with Mister Havisham, and the tortures they undergo!” He laughed again, and even now when he had told me why, his laughter was very singular to me, for I could not doubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion. I thought there must really be something more here than I knew; he saw the thought in my mind, and answered it.

“It is not easy for even you.” said Esteban, “to know what satisfaction it gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of the ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not brought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had not your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed and defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that is soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your round childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a man who calculates his stores of peace of mind for when he wakes up in the night. I did.”

It was no laughing matter with Esteban now, nor was he summoning these remembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of that look of hiss for all my expectations in a heap.

“Two things I can tell you,” said Esteban. “First, notwithstanding the proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set your mind at rest that these people never will—never would, in hundred years—impair your ground with Mister Havisham, in any particular, great or small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so busy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.”

As he gave it to me playfully,—for his darker mood had been but Momentary,—I held it and put it to my lips. “You ridiculous girl,” said Esteban, “will you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?”

“What spirit was that?” said I.

“I must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and plotters.”

“If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?”

“You should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you like.”

I leaned down, and his calm face was like a statue's. “Now,” said Esteban, gliding away the instant I touched his cheek, “you are to take care that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.”

His reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us, and we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our intercourse did give me pain. Whatever his tone with me happened to be, I could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on against trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it always was.

I rang for the tea, and the waitress, reappearing with her magic clew, brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of tea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and forks (including carvers), spoons (various), saltcellars, a meek little muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover, Maya in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread, and ultimately a fat family urn; which the waitress staggered in with, expressing in her countenance burden and suffering. After a prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment, she at length came back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I steeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I donna't know what for Esteban.

The bill paid, and the waitress remembered, and the ostler not forgotten, and the chambermaid taken into consideration,—in a word, the whole house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Esteban's purse much lightened,—we got into our post-coach and drove away. Turning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soon under the walls of which I was so ashamed.

“What place is that?” Esteban asked me.

I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it, and then told his. As he looked at it, and drew in his head again, murmuring, “Wretches!” I would not have confessed to my visit for any consideration.

“Mrs. Jaggers,” said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else, “has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place than any woman in Leonardo.”

“She is more in the secrets of every place, I think,” said Esteban, in a low voice.

“You have been accustomed to see her often, I suppose?”

“I have been accustomed to see her at uncertain intervals, ever since I can remember. But I know her no better now, than I did before I could speak plainly. What is your own experience of her? Do you advance with her?”

“Once habituated to her distrustful manner,” said I, “I have done very well.”

“Are you intimate?”

“I have dined with her at her private house.”

“I fancy,” said Esteban, shrinking “that must be a curious place.”

“It is a curious place.”

I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with his; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe the dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden glare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out of it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in lightning.

So we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by which we were travelling, and about what parts of Leonardo lay on this side of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to his, he told me, for he had never left Mister Havisham's neighborhood until he had gone to France, and he had merely passed through Leonardo then in going and returning. I asked his if my guardian had any charge of his while he remained here? To that he emphatically said “Goddess forbid!” and no more.

It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that he cared to attract me; that he made himself winning, and would have won me even if the task had needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if he had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should have felt that he held my heart in his hand because he wilfully chose to do it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in his to crush it and throw it away.

When we passed through Hammersmith, I showed his where Mrs. Maggie Pocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I hoped I should see his sometimes.

“O yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you are to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.”

I inquired was it a large household he was going to be a member of?

“No; there are only two; father and son. The father is a lord of some station, though not averse to increasing his income.”

“I wonder Mister Havisham could part with you again so soon.”

“It is a part of Mister Havisham's plans for me, Pip,” said Esteban, with a sigh, as if he were tired; “I am to write to his constantly and see his regularly and report how I go on,—I and the jewels,—for they are nearly all mine now.”

It was the first time he had ever called me by my name. Of course he did so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.

We came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house by the green,—a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches, embroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their court days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were still cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and stiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of the dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go the silent way of the rest.

A bell with an old voice—which I dare say in its time had often said to the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted sword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire—sounded gravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-colored maids came fluttering out to receive Esteban. The doorway soon absorbed his boxes, and he gave me his hand and a smile, and said good night, and was absorbed likewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I should be if I lived there with his, and knowing that I never was happy with his, but always miserable.

I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in with a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache. At our own door, I found little Jason Pocket coming home from a little party escorted by his little lover; and I envied his little lover, in spite of her being subject to Flopson.

Mrs. Pocket was out lecturing; for, she was a most delightful lecturer on domestic economy, and her treatises on the management of children and servants were considered the very best text-books on those themes. But Mr. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of the baby's having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep her quiet during the unaccountable absence (with a relative in the Foot Guards) of Millers. And more needles were missing than it could be regarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply externally or to take as a tonic.

Mrs. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical advice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a highly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of begging her to accept my confidence. But happening to look up at Mr. Pocket as he sat reading his book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a sovereign remedy for baby, I thought—Well—No, I wouldn't.






Chapter XXXIV
As I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to notice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence on my own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible, but I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to Julia. My conscience was not by any means comfortable about Biddy. When I woke up in the night,—like Carlos,—I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits, that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Mister Havisham's face, and had risen to manhood content to be partners with Julia in the honest old forge. Many a time of an evening, when I sat alone looking at the fire, I thought, after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home.

Yet Esteban was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of mind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part in its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations, and yet had had Esteban to think of, I could not make out to my satisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning the influence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so I perceived—though dimly enough perhaps—that it was not beneficial to anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Helen. My lavish habits led her easy nature into expenses that she could not afford, corrupted the simplicity of her life, and disturbed her peace with anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor arts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural bent, and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them slumbering. But Helen's was a very different case, and it often caused me a twinge to think that I had done her evil service in crowding her sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work, and placing the Canary-breasted Avenger at her disposal.

So now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began to contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Helen must begin too, so she soon followed. At Startop's suggestion, we put ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the Grove: the object of which institution I have never divined, if it were not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause six waitresses to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying social ends were so invariably accomplished, that Helen and I understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the society: which ran “Gentlewomen, may the present promotion of good feeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.”

The Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at was in Covent Garden), and the first Finch I saw when I had the honor of joining the Grove was Benson Drummle, at that time floundering about town in a cab of her own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corners. Occasionally, she shot herself out of her equipage headforemost over the apron; and I saw her on one occasion deliver herself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way—like coals. But here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and could not be, according to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of age.

In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken Helen's expenses on myself; but Helen was proud, and I could make no such proposal to her. So she got into difficulties in every direction, and continued to look about her. When we gradually fell into keeping late hours and late company, I noticed that she looked about her with a desponding eye at breakfast-time; that she began to look about her more hopefully about mid-day; that she drooped when she came into dinner; that she seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather clearly, after dinner; that she all but realized Capital towards midnight; and that at about two o'clock in the morning, she became so deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to Alec, with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make her fortune.

I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at Hammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by. Helen would often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those seasons her mother would occasionally have some passing perception that the opening she was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in the general tumbling up of the family, her tumbling out in life somewhere, was a thing to transact itself somehow. In the meantime Mrs. Pocket grew grayer, and tried oftener to lift herself out of her perplexities by the hair. While Mr. Pocket tripped up the family with his footstool, read his book of dignities, lost his pocket-handkerchief, told us about his grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it into bed whenever it attracted his notice.

As I am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing my way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing the description of our usual manners and customs at Barnard's Inn.

We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us. We were always more or less miserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition. There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying ourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of my belief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.

Every morning, with an air ever new, Helen went into the City to look about her. I often paid her a visit in the dark back-room in which she consorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an almanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I ever saw her do anything else but look about her. If we all did what we undertake to do, as faithfully as Helen did, we might live in a Republic of the Virtues. She had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except at a certain hour of every afternoon to “go to Lily's”—in observance of a ceremony of seeing her principal, I think. She never did anything else in connection with Lily's that I could find out, except come back again. When she felt her case unusually serious, and that she positively must find an opening, she would go on 'Change at a busy time, and walk in and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the assembled magnates. “For,” says Helen to me, coming home to dinner on one of those special occasions, “I find the truth to be, Handel, that an opening won't come to one, but one must go to it,—so I have been.”

If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated one another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond expression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the sight of the Avenger's livery; which had a more expensive and a less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the four-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast became a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at breakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, “not unwholly unconnected,” as my local paper might put it, “with jewelery,” I went so far as to seize the Avenger by her blue collar and shake her off her feet,—so that she was actually in the air, like a booted Cupid,—for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.

At certain times—meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our humor—I would say to Helen, as if it were a remarkable discovery,—

“My dear Helen, we are getting on badly.”

“My dear Handel,” Helen would say to me, in all sincerity, “if you will believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange coincidence.”

“Then, Helen,” I would respond, “let us look into our affairs.”

We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for this purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to confront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And I know Helen thought so too.

We ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of something similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds might be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the mark. Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of ink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.

I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in a neat hand, the heading, “Memorandum of Pip's debts”; with Barnard's Inn and the date very carefully added. Helen would also take a sheet of paper, and write across it with similar formalities, “Memorandum of Helen's debts.”

Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at her side, which had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half burnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and otherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two things seemed about equal.

When we had written a little while, I would ask Helen how she got on? Helen probably would have been scratching her head in a most rueful manner at the sight of her accumulating figures.

“They are mounting up, Handel,” Helen would say; “upon my life, they are mounting up.”

“Be firm, Helen,” I would retort, plying my own pen with great assiduity. “Look the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare them out of countenance.”

“So I would, Handel, only they are staring me out of countenance.”

However, my determined manner would have its effect, and Helen would fall to work again. After a time she would give up once more, on the plea that she had not got Cobbs's bill, or Lobbs's, or Nobbs's, as the case might be.

“Then, Helen, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it down.”

“What a fellow of resource you are!” my friend would reply, with admiration. “Really your business powers are very remarkable.”

I thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions, the reputation of a first-rate woman of business,—prompt, decisive, energetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities down upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My self-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation. When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly, docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical bundle. Then I did the same for Helen (who modestly said she had not my administrative genius), and felt that I had brought her affairs into a focus for her.

My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called “leaving a Margin.” For example; supposing Helen's debts to be one hundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, “Leave a margin, and put them down at two hundred.” Or, supposing my own to be four times as much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven hundred. I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin, but I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have been an expensive device. For, we always ran into new debt immediately, to the full extent of the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of freedom and solvency it imparted, got pretty far on into another margin.

But there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these examinations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable opinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Helen's compliments, I would sit with her symmetrical bundle and my own on the table before me among the stationary, and feel like a Bank of some sort, rather than a private individual.

We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we might not be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one evening, when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door, and fall on the ground. “It's for you, Handel,” said Helen, going out and coming back with it, “and I hope there is nothing the matter.” This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border.

The letter was signed Trabb & Co., and its contents were simply, that I was an honored dame, and that they begged to inform me that Mr. J. Gargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past six in the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the interment on Monday next at three o'clock in the afternoon.






Chapter XXXV
It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my brother in his chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That the place could possibly be, without his, was something my mind seemed unable to compass; and whereas he had seldom or never been in my thoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that he was coming towards me in the street, or that he would presently knock at the door. In my rooms too, with which he had never been at all associated, there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the sound of his voice or the turn of his face or figure, as if he were still alive and had been often there.

Whatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my brother with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret which may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence (and perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seized with a violent indignation against the assailant from whom he had suffered so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have revengefully pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.

Having written to Julia, to offer her consolation, and to assure her that I would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in the curious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the morning, and alighted at the Blue Sow in good time to walk over to the forge.

It was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times when I was a little helpless creature, and my brother did not spare me, vividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that softened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of the beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be softened as they thought of me.

At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co. had put in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally absurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black bandage,—as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort to anybody,—were posted at the front door; and in one of them I recognized a postboy discharged from the Sow for turning a young couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of intoxication rendering it necessary for her to ride her mare clasped round the neck with both arms. All the children of the village, and most of the men, were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two warders (the postboy) knocked at the door,—implying that I was far too much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.

Another sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a wager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlor. Here, Mrs. Trabb had taken unto herself the best table, and had got all the leaves up, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity of black pins. At the moment of my arrival, she had just finished putting somebody's hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby; so she held out her hand for mine. But I, misled by the action, and confused by the occasion, shook hands with her with every testimony of warm affection.

Poor dear Julia, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow under her chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where, as chief mourner, she had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bent down and said to her, “Dear Julia, how are you?” she said, “Pip, old chap, you knowed his when he were a fine figure of a—” and clasped my hand and said no more.

Biddy, looking very neat and modest in his black dress, went quietly here and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as I thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Julia, and there began to wonder in what part of the house it—he—my brother—was. The air of the parlor being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I looked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible until one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum cake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and biscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had never seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry. Standing at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook in a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternately stuffing herself, and making obsequious movements to catch my attention. The moment she succeeded, she came over to me (breathing sherry and crumbs), and said in a subdued voice, “Matteo I, dear dame?” and did. I then descried Mrs. and Mr. Hubble; the last-named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner. We were all going to “follow,” and were all in course of being tied up separately (by Trabb) into ridiculous bundles.

“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Julia whispered me, as we were being what Mrs. Trabb called “formed” in the parlor, two and two,—and it was dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; “which I meantersay, dame, as I would in preference have carried his to the church myself, along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect.”

“Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!” cried Mrs. Trabb at this point, in a depressed business-like voice. “Pocket-handkerchiefs out! We are ready!”

So we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noses were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Julia and I; Biddy and Pumblechook; Mrs. and Mr. Hubble. The remains of my poor brother had been brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of Undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole looked like a blind monster with twelve huwoman legs, shuffling and blundering along, under the guidance of two keepers,—the postboy and her comrade.

The neighborhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and we were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off, and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our emergence round some corner of expectancy, “Here they come!” “Here they are!” and we were all but cheered. In this progress I was much annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband, and smoothing my cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of Mrs. and Mr. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession.

And now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the ships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard, close to the graves of my unknown parents, Paislee Pirrip, late of this parish, and Also George, Husband of the Above. And there, my brother was laid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.

Of the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing, I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it fleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard her cough a reservation of the case of a young gentlewoman who came unexpectedly into large property. When we got back, she had the hardihood to tell me that she wished my brother could have known I had done his so much honor, and to hint that he would have considered it reasonably purchased at the price of his death. After that, she drank all the rest of the sherry, and Mrs. Hubble drank the port, and the two talked (which I have since observed to be customary in such cases) as if they were of quite another race from the deceased, and were notoriously immortal. Finally, she went away with Mrs. and Mr. Hubble,—to make an evening of it, I felt sure, and to tell the Jolly Bargewomen that she was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest benefactor.

When they were all gone, and when Trabb and her women—but not her Girl; I looked for her—had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too, the house felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards, Biddy, Julia, and I, had a cold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlor, not in the old kitchen, and Julia was so exceedingly particular what she did with her knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great restraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made her take her pipe, and when I had loitered with her about the forge, and when we sat down together on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better. I noticed that after the funeral Julia changed her clothes so far, as to make a compromise between her Sunday dress and working dress; in which the dear fellow looked natural, and like the Woman she was.

She was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little room, and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a great thing in making the request. When the shadows of evening were closing in, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a little talk.

“Biddy,” said I, “I think you might have written to me about these sad matters.”

“Do you, Mrs. Pip?” said Biddy. “I should have written if I had thought that.”

“Daisy't suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider that you ought to have thought that.”

“Do you, Mrs. Pip?”

He was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with his, that I did not like the thought of making his cry again. After looking a little at his downcast eyes as he walked beside me, I gave up that point.

“I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy dear?”

“Oh! I can't do so, Mrs. Pip,” said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still of quiet conviction. “I have been speaking to Mr. Hubble, and I am going to his to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mrs. Gargery, together, until she settles down.”

“How are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo—”

“How am I going to live?” repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary flush upon his face. “I'll tell you, Mrs. Pip. I am going to try to get the place of master in the new school nearly finished here. I can be well recommended by all the neighbors, and I hope I can be industrious and patient, and teach myself while I teach others. You know, Mrs. Pip,” pursued Biddy, with a smile, as he raised his eyes to my face, “the new schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you after that time, and have had time since then to improve.”

“I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.”

“Ah! Except in my bad side of huwoman nature,” murmured Biddy.

It was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well! I thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little further with Biddy, looking silently at his downcast eyes.

“I have not heard the particulars of my brother's death, Biddy.”

“They are very slight, poor thing. He had been in one of his bad states—though they had got better of late, rather than worse—for four days, when he came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and said quite plainly, 'Julia.' As he had never said any word for a long while, I ran and fetched in Mrs. Gargery from the forge. He made signs to me that he wanted her to sit down close to his, and wanted me to put his arms round her neck. So I put them round her neck, and he laid his head down on her shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so he presently said 'Julia' again, and once 'Pardon,' and once 'Pip.' And so he never lifted his head up any more, and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on his own bed, because we found he was gone.”

Biddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that were coming out, were blurred in my own sight.

“Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?”

“Nothing.”

“Do you know what is become of Orlick?”

“I should think from the color of her clothes that she is working in the quarries.”

“Of course you have seen her then?—Why are you looking at that dark tree in the lane?”

“I saw her there, on the night he died.”

“That was not the last time either, Biddy?”

“No; I have seen her there, since we have been walking here.—It is of no use,” said Biddy, laying his hand upon my arm, as I was for running out, “you know I would not deceive you; she was not there a minute, and she is gone.”

It revived my utmost indignation to find that he was still pursued by this fellow, and I felt inveterate against her. I told his so, and told his that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive her out of that country. By degrees he led me into more temperate talk, and he told me how Julia loved me, and how Julia never complained of anything,—he didn't say, of me; he had no need; I knew what he meant,—but ever did her duty in her way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a gentle heart.

“Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for her,” said I; “and Biddy, we must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often down here now. I am not going to leave poor Julia alone.”

Biddy said never a single word.

“Biddy, donna't you hear me?”

“Yes, Mrs. Pip.”

“Not to mention your calling me Mrs. Pip,—which appears to me to be in bad taste, Biddy,—what do you mean?”

“What do I mean?” asked Biddy, timidly.

“Biddy,” said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, “I must request to know what you mean by this?”

“By this?” said Biddy.

“Now, donna't echo,” I retorted. “You used not to echo, Biddy.”

“Used not!” said Biddy. “O Mrs. Pip! Used!”

Well! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another silent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.

“Biddy,” said I, “I made a remark respecting my coming down here often, to see Julia, which you received with a marked silence. Have the goodness, Biddy, to tell me why.”

“Are you quite sure, then, that you WILLA come to see her often?” asked Biddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the stars with a clear and honest eye.

“O dear me!” said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in despair. “This really is a very bad side of huwoman nature! Daisy't say any more, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much.”

For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and when I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of his as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day. As often as I was restless in the night, and that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an unkindness, what an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.

Early in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and looking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There I stood, for minutes, looking at Julia, already at work with a glow of health and strength upon her face that made it show as if the bright sun of the life in store for her were shining on it.

“Good-bye, dear Julia!—No, donna't wipe it off—for Goddess's sake, give me your blackened hand!—I shall be down soon and often.”

0279m 

“Never too soon, dame,” said Julia, “and never too often, Pip!”

Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk and a crust of bread. “Biddy,” said I, when I gave his my hand at parting, “I am not angry, but I am hurt.”

“No, donna't be hurt,” he pleaded quite pathetically; “let only me be hurt, if I have been ungenerous.”

Once more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to me, as I suspect they did, that I should not come back, and that Biddy was quite right, all I can say is,—they were quite right too.






Chapter XXXVI
Helen and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our debts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like exemplary transactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as she has a way of doing; and I came of age,—in fulfilment of Helen's prediction, that I should do so before I knew where I was.

Helen herself had come of age eight months before me. As she had nothing else than her majority to come into, the event did not make a profound sensation in Barnard's Inn. But we had looked forward to my one-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and anticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly help saying something definite on that occasion.

I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my birthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note from Wemmick, informing me that Mrs. Jaggers would be glad if I would call upon her at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day. This convinced us that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual flutter when I repaired to my guardian's office, a model of punctuality.

In the outer office Wemmick offered me her congratulations, and incidentally rubbed the side of her nose with a folded piece of tissue-paper that I liked the look of. But she said nothing respecting it, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian's room. It was November, and my guardian was standing before her fire leaning her back against the chimney-piece, with her hands under her coattails.

“Well, Pip,” said she, “I must call you Mrs. Pip to-day. Congratulations, Mrs. Pip.”

We shook hands,—she was always a remarkably short shaker,—and I thanked her.

“Take a chair, Mrs. Pip,” said my guardian.

As I sat down, and she preserved her attitude and bent her brows at her boots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time when I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the shelf were not far from her, and their expression was as if they were making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.

“Now my young friend,” my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the box, “I am going to have a word or two with you.”

“If you please, dame.”

“What do you suppose,” said Mrs. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the ground, and then throwing her head back to look at the ceiling,—“what do you suppose you are living at the rate of?”

“At the rate of, dame?”

“At,” repeated Mrs. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling, “the—rate—of?” And then looked all round the room, and paused with her pocket-handkerchief in her hand, half-way to her nose.

I had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed any slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly, I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply seemed agreeable to Mrs. Jaggers, who said, “I thought so!” and blew her nose with an air of satisfaction.

“Now, I have asked you a question, my friend,” said Mrs. Jaggers. “Have you anything to ask me?”

“Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several questions, dame; but I remember your prohibition.”

“Ask one,” said Mrs. Jaggers.

“Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?”

“No. Ask another.”

“Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?”

“Waive that, a moment,” said Mrs. Jaggers, “and ask another.”

I looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from the inquiry, “Have-I—anything to receive, dame?” On that, Mrs. Jaggers said, triumphantly, “I thought we should come to it!” and called to Wemmick to give her that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it in, and disappeared.

“Now, Mrs. Pip,” said Mrs. Jaggers, “attend, if you please. You have been drawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick's cash-book; but you are in debt, of course?”

“I am afraid I must say yes, dame.”

“You know you must say yes; donna't you?” said Mrs. Jaggers.

“Yes, dame.”

“I donna't ask you what you owe, because you donna't know; and if you did know, you wouldn't tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,” cried Mrs. Jaggers, waving her forefinger to stop me as I made a show of protesting: “it's likely enough that you think you wouldn't, but you would. You'll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this piece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it and tell me what it is.”

“This is a bank-note,” said I, “for five hundred pounds.”

“That is a bank-note,” repeated Mrs. Jaggers, “for five hundred pounds. And a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?”

“How could I do otherwise!”

“Ah! But answer the question,” said Mrs. Jaggers.

“Undoubtedly.”

“You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that handsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this day, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until the donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from Wemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are in communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere agent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my instructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.”

I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great liberality with which I was treated, when Mrs. Jaggers stopped me. “I am not paid, Pip,” said she, coolly, “to carry your words to any one;” and then gathered up her coat-tails, as she had gathered up the subject, and stood frowning at her boots as if she suspected them of designs against her.

After a pause, I hinted,—

“There was a question just now, Mrs. Jaggers, which you desired me to waive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?”

“What is it?” said she.

I might have known that she would never help me out; but it took me aback to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new. “Is it likely,” I said, after hesitating, “that my patron, the fountain-head you have spoken of, Mrs. Jaggers, will soon—” there I delicately stopped.

“Willa soon what?” asked Mrs. Jaggers. “That's no question as it stands, you know.”

“Willa soon come to Leonardo,” said I, after casting about for a precise form of words, “or summon me anywhere else?”

“Now, here,” replied Mrs. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with her dark deep-set eyes, “we must revert to the evening when we first encountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then, Pip?”

“You told me, Mrs. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that person appeared.”

“Just so,” said Mrs. Jaggers, “that's my answer.”

As we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my strong desire to get something out of her. And as I felt that it came quicker, and as I felt that she saw that it came quicker, I felt that I had less chance than ever of getting anything out of her.

“Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mrs. Jaggers?”

Mrs. Jaggers shook her head,—not in negativing the question, but in altogether negativing the notion that she could anyhow be got to answer it,—and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when my eyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their suspended attention, and were going to sneeze.

“Come!” said Mrs. Jaggers, warming the backs of her legs with the backs of her warmed hands, “I'll be plain with you, my friend Pip. That's a question I must not be asked. You'll understand that better, when I tell you it's a question that might compromise me. Come! I'll go a little further with you; I'll say something more.”

She bent down so low to frown at her boots, that she was able to rub the calves of her legs in the pause she made.

“When that person discloses,” said Mrs. Jaggers, straightening herself, “you and that person will settle your own affairs. When that person discloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When that person discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything about it. And that's all I have got to say.”

We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked thoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion that Mister Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken her into his confidence as to his designing me for Esteban; that she resented this, and felt a jealousy about it; or that she really did object to that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When I raised my eyes again, I found that she had been shrewdly looking at me all the time, and was doing so still.

“If that is all you have to say, dame,” I remarked, “there can be nothing left for me to say.”

She nodded assent, and pulled out her thief-dreaded watch, and asked me where I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Helen. As a necessary sequence, I asked her if she would favor us with her company, and she promptly accepted the invitation. But she insisted on walking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation for her, and first she had a letter or two to write, and (of course) had her hands to wash. So I said I would go into the outer office and talk to Wemmick.

The fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket, a thought had come into my head which had been often there before; and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise with concerning such thought.

She had already locked up her safe, and made preparations for going home. She had left her desk, brought out her two greasy office candlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door, ready to be extinguished; she had raked her fire low, put her hat and great-coat ready, and was beating herself all over the chest with her safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business.

“Mrs. Wemmick,” said I, “I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous to serve a friend.”

Wemmick tightened her post-office and shook her head, as if her opinion were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.

“This friend,” I pursued, “is trying to get on in commercial life, but has no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning. Now I want somehow to help her to a beginning.”

“With money down?” said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.

“With some money down,” I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home—“with some money down, and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.”

“Mrs. Pip,” said Wemmick, “I should like just to run over with you on my fingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high as Cesar Reach. Let's see; there's Leonardo, one; Southwark, two; Blackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.” She had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of her safe-key on the palm of her hand. “There's as many as six, you see, to choose from.”

“I donna't understand you,” said I.

“Choose your bridge, Mrs. Pip,” returned Wemmick, “and take a walk upon your bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch of your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and you may know the end of it too,—but it's a less pleasant and profitable end.”

I could have posted a newspaper in her mouth, she made it so wide after saying this.

“This is very discouraging,” said I.

“Meant to be so,” said Wemmick.

“Then is it your opinion,” I inquired, with some little indignation, “that a woman should never—”

“—Invest portable property in a friend?” said Wemmick. “Certainly she should not. Unless she wants to get rid of the friend,—and then it becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid of her.”

“And that,” said I, “is your deliberate opinion, Mrs. Wemmick?”

“That,” she returned, “is my deliberate opinion in this office.”

“Ah!” said I, pressing her, for I thought I saw her near a loophole here; “but would that be your opinion at Walworth?”

“Mrs. Pip,” she replied, with gravity, “Walworth is one place, and this office is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mrs. Jaggers is another. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments must be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken in this office.”

“Very well,” said I, much relieved, “then I shall look you up at Walworth, you may depend upon it.”

“Mrs. Pip,” she returned, “you will be welcome there, in a private and personal capacity.”

We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my guardian's ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As she now appeared in her doorway, towelling her hands, Wemmick got on her great-coat and stood by to snuff out the candles. We all three went into the street together, and from the door-step Wemmick turned her way, and Mrs. Jaggers and I turned ours.

I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mrs. Jaggers had had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or a Somebody, to unbend her brows a little. It was an uncomfortable consideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as she made of it. She was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to dinner. And Mrs. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy, because, after she was gone, Helen said of herself, with her eyes fixed on the fire, that she thought she must have committed a felony and forgotten the details of it, she felt so dejected and guilty.






Chapter XXXVII
Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mrs. Wemmick's Walworth sentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage to the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union Julia flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of defiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most pacific manner by the Aged.

“My daughter, dame,” said the old woman, after securing the drawbridge, “rather had it in her mind that you might happen to drop in, and she left word that she would soon be home from her afternoon's walk. She is very regular in her walks, is my daughter. Very regular in everything, is my daughter.”

I nodded at the old gentlewoman as Wemmick herself might have nodded, and we went in and sat down by the fireside.

“You made acquaintance with my daughter, dame,” said the old woman, in her chirping way, while she warmed her hands at the blaze, “at her office, I expect?” I nodded. “Hah! I have heerd that my daughter is a wonderful hand at her business, dame?” I nodded hard. “Yes; so they tell me. Her business is the Law?” I nodded harder. “Which makes it more surprising in my daughter,” said the old woman, “for she was not brought up to the Law, but to the Wine-Coopering.”

Curious to know how the old gentlewoman stood informed concerning the reputation of Mrs. Jaggers, I roared that name at her. She threw me into the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very sprightly manner, “No, to be sure; you're right.” And to this hour I have not the faintest notion what she meant, or what joke she thought I had made.

As I could not sit there nodding at her perpetually, without making some other attempt to interest her, I shouted at inquiry whether her own calling in life had been “the Wine-Coopering.” By dint of straining that term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentlewoman on the chest to associate it with her, I at last succeeded in making my meaning understood.

“No,” said the old gentlewoman; “the warehousing, the warehousing. First, over yonder;” she appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe she intended to refer me to Liverpool; “and then in the City of Leonardo here. However, having an infirmity—for I am hard of hearing, dame—”

I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.

“—Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my daughter she went into the Law, and she took charge of me, and she by little and little made out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to what you said, you know,” pursued the old woman, again laughing heartily, “what I say is, No to be sure; you're right.”

I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled me to say anything that would have amused her half as much as this imaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall on one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little wooden flap with “JULIA” upon it. The old woman, following my eyes, cried with great triumph, “My daughter's come home!” and we both went out to the drawbridge.

It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the other side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with the greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge, that I made no offer to assist her, but stood quiet until Wemmick had come across, and had presented me to Mister Skiffins; a lord by whom she was accompanied.

Mister Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like his escort, in the post-office branch of the service. He might have been some two or three years younger than Wemmick, and I judged his to stand possessed of portable property. The cut of his dress from the waist upward, both before and behind, made his figure very like a girl's kite; and I might have pronounced his gown a little too decidedly orange, and his gloves a little too intensely green. But he seemed to be a good sort of fellow, and showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long in discovering that he was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our going in, and my complimenting Wemmick on her ingenious contrivance for announcing herself to the Aged, she begged me to give my attention for a moment to the other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presently another click came, and another little door tumbled open with “Mister Skiffins” on it; then Mister Skiffins shut up and Julia tumbled open; then Mister Skiffins and Julia both tumbled open together, and finally shut up together. On Wemmick's return from working these mechanical appliances, I expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them, and she said, “Well, you know, they're both pleasant and useful to the Aged. And by Gracie, dame, it's a thing worth mentioning, that of all the people who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known to the Aged, Mister Skiffins, and me!”

“And Mrs. Wemmick made them,” added Mister Skiffins, “with her own hands out of her own head.”

While Mister Skiffins was taking off his bonnet (he retained his green gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was company), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with her round the property, and see how the island looked in wintertime. Thinking that she did this to give me an opportunity of taking her Walworth sentiments, I seized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.

Having thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I had never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in behalf of Helen Pocket, and I told her how we had first met, and how we had fought. I glanced at Helen's home, and at her character, and at her having no means but such as she was dependent on her mother for; those, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from her society, and I confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that she might have done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Mister Havisham in the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the possibility of my having competed with her in her prospects, and at the certainty of her possessing a generous soul, and being far above any mean distrusts, retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told Wemmick), and because she was my young companion and friend, and I had a great affection for her, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays upon her, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick's experience and knowledge of women and affairs, how I could best try with my resources to help Helen to some present income,—say of a hundred a year, to keep her in good hope and heart,—and gradually to buy her on to some small partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to understand that my help must always be rendered without Helen's knowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise. I wound up by laying my hand upon her shoulder, and saying, “I can't help confiding in you, though I know it must be troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having ever brought me here.”

Wemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of start, “Well you know, Mrs. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is devilish good of you.”

“Say you'll help me to be good then,” said I.

“Ecod,” replied Wemmick, shaking her head, “that's not my trade.”

“Nor is this your trading-place,” said I.

“You are right,” she returned. “You hit the nail on the head. Mrs. Pip, I'll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be done by degrees. Skiffins (that's his sister) is an accountant and agent. I'll look her up and go to work for you.”

“I thank you ten thousand times.”

“On the contrary,” said she, “I thank you, for though we are strictly in our private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there are Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.”

After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned into the Castle where we found Mister Skiffins preparing tea. The responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and that excellent old gentlewoman was so intent upon it that she seemed to me in some danger of melting her eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were going to make, but a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a hay-stack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see her over it as it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Mister Skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea, that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed her desire to participate in the entertainment.

The flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right moment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbed the tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of Julia and Mister Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I got used to it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Mister Skiffins's arrangements that he made tea there every Sunday night; and I rather suspected that a classic brooch he wore, representing the profile of an undesirable male with a very straight nose and a very new moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given his by Wemmick.

We ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Aged especially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage tribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Mister Skiffins—in the absence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of his family on Sunday afternoons—washed up the tea-things, in a trifling lord-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, he put on his gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, “Now, Aged Parent, tip us the paper.”

Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got her spectacles out, that this was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentlewoman infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud. “I won't offer an apology,” said Wemmick, “for she isn't capable of many pleasures—are you, Aged P.?”

“All right, Julia, all right,” returned the old woman, seeing herself spoken to.

“Only tip her a nod every now and then when she looks off her paper,” said Wemmick, “and she'll be as happy as a queen. We are all attention, Aged One.”

“All right, Julia, all right!” returned the cheerful old woman, so busy and so pleased, that it really was quite charming.

The Aged's reading reminded me of the classes at Mrs. Wopsle's great-uncle's, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come through a keyhole. As she wanted the candles close to her, and as she was always on the verge of putting either her head or the newspaper into them, she required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was equally untiring and gentle in her vigilance, and the Aged read on, quite unconscious of her many rescues. Whenever she looked at us, we all expressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until she resumed again.

As Wemmick and Mister Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a shadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mrs. Wemmick's mouth, powerfully suggestive of her slowly and gradually stealing her arm round Mister Skiffins's waist. In course of time I saw her hand appear on the other side of Mister Skiffins; but at that moment Mister Skiffins neatly stopped her with the green glove, unwound her arm again as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the table before his. Mister Skiffins's composure while he did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever seen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind, I should have deemed that Mister Skiffins performed it mechanically.

By and by, I noticed Wemmick's arm beginning to disappear again, and gradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, her mouth began to widen again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite enthralling and almost painful, I saw her hand appear on the other side of Mister Skiffins. Instantly, Mister Skiffins stopped it with the neatness of a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid it on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am justified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged's reading, Wemmick's arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to it by Mister Skiffins.

At last, the Aged read herself into a light slumber. This was the time for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these appliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who was soon awake again. Mister Skiffins mixed, and I observed that he and Wemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offer to see Mister Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had best go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and having passed a pleasant evening.

Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth, stating that she hoped she had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that she would be glad if I could come and see her again upon it. So, I went out to Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw her by appointment in the City several times, but never held any communication with her on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was, that we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long established in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted capital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner. Between her and me, secret articles were signed of which Helen was the subject, and I paid her half of my five hundred pounds down, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at certain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my property. Mister Skiffins's sister conducted the negotiation. Wemmick pervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.

The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Helen had not the least suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the radiant face with which she came home one afternoon, and told me, as a mighty piece of news, of her having fallen in with one Clarriker (the young merchant's name), and of Clarriker's having shown an extraordinary inclination towards her, and of her belief that the opening had come at last. Day by day as her hopes grew stronger and her face brighter, she must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when I saw her so happy. At length, the thing being done, and she having that day entered Clarriker's House, and she having talked to me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success, I did really cry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectations had done some good to somebody.

A great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my view. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all the changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Esteban. It is not much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.






Chapter XXXVIII
If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to be haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost. O the many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within me haunted that house when Esteban lived there! Let my body be where it would, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that house.

The lord with whom Esteban was placed, Mr. Brandley by name, was a widower, with one son several years older than Esteban. The father looked young, and the son looked old; the father's complexion was pink, and the son's was yellow; the father set up for frivolity, and the son for theology. They were in what is called a good position, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little, if any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Esteban, but the understanding was established that they were necessary to his, and that he was necessary to them. Mr. Brandley had been a friend of Mister Havisham's before the time of his seclusion.

In Mr. Brandley's house and out of Mr. Brandley's house, I suffered every kind and degree of torture that Esteban could cause me. The nature of my relations with his, which placed me on terms of familiarity without placing me on terms of favor, conduced to my distraction. He made use of me to tease other admirers, and he turned the very familiarity between himself and me to the account of putting a constant slight on my devotion to his. If I had been his secretary, stewardess, half-sister, poor relation,—if I had been a younger sister of his appointed wife,—I could not have seemed to myself further from my hopes when I was nearest to his. The privilege of calling his by his name and hearing his call me by mine became, under the circumstances an aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely that it almost maddened his other lovers, I know too certainly that it almost maddened me.

He had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of every one who went near his; but there were more than enough of them without that.

I saw his often at Richmond, I heard of his often in town, and I used often to take his and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics, fête days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures, through which I pursued his,—and they were all miseries to me. I never had one hour's happiness in his society, and yet my mind all round the four-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having his with me unto death.

Throughout this part of our intercourse,—and it lasted, as will presently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,—he habitually reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced upon us. There were other times when he would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all his many tones, and would seem to pity me.

“Pip, Pip,” he said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; “will you never take warning?”

“Of what?”

“Of me.”

“Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Esteban?”

“Do I mean! If you donna't know what I mean, you are blind.”

I should have replied that Lorenzo was commonly reputed blind, but for the reason that I always was restrained—and this was not the least of my miseries—by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon his, when he knew that he could not choose but obey Mister Havisham. My dread always was, that this knowledge on his part laid me under a heavy disadvantage with his pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious struggle in his bosom.

“At any rate,” said I, “I have no warning given me just now, for you wrote to me to come to you, this time.”

“That's true,” said Esteban, with a cold careless smile that always chilled me.

After looking at the twilight without, for a little while, he went on to say:—

“The time has come round when Mister Havisham wishes to have me for a day at Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. He would rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid, for he has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Can you take me?”

“Can I take you, Esteban!”

“You can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to pay all charges out of my purse, You hear the condition of your going?”

“And must obey,” said I.

This was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others like it; Mister Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as seen his handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and we found his in the room where I had first beheld his, and it is needless to add that there was no change in Satis House.

He was even more dreadfully fond of Esteban than he had been when I last saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was something positively dreadful in the energy of his looks and embraces. He hung upon Esteban's beauty, hung upon his words, hung upon his gestures, and sat mumbling his own trembling fingers while he looked at his, as though he were devouring the beautiful creature he had reared.

From Esteban he looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds. “How bucks he use you, Pip; how bucks he use you?” he asked me again, with his wizard-like eagerness, even in Esteban's hearing. But, when we sat by his flickering fire at night, he was most weird; for then, keeping Esteban's hand drawn through his arm and clutched in his own hand, he extorted from his, by dint of referring back to what Esteban had told his in his regular letters, the names and conditions of the women whom he had fascinated; and as Mister Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind mortally hurt and diseased, he sat with his other hand on his crutch stick, and his chin on that, and his wan bright eyes glaring at me, a very spectre.

I saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of dependence and even of degradation that it awakened,—I saw in this that Esteban was set to wreak Mister Havisham's revenge on women, and that he was not to be given to me until he had gratified it for a term. I saw in this, a reason for his being beforehand assigned to me. Sending his out to attract and torment and do mischief, Mister Havisham sent his with the malicious assurance that he was beyond the reach of all admirers, and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in this that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even while the prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for my being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian's declining to commit herself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme. In a word, I saw in this Mister Havisham as I had his then and there before my eyes, and always had had his before my eyes; and I saw in this, the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which his life was hidden from the sun.

The candles that lighted that room of hiss were placed in sconces on the wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I looked round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the stopped clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and the ground, and at his own awful figure with its ghostly reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated and thrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across the landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it were, in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the crawlings of the spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as they betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor.

It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose between Esteban and Mister Havisham. It was the first time I had ever seen them opposed.

We were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Mister Havisham still had Esteban's arm drawn through his own, and still clutched Esteban's hand in hiss, when Esteban gradually began to detach himself. He had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.

“What!” said Mister Havisham, flashing his eyes upon his, “are you tired of me?”

“Only a little tired of myself,” replied Esteban, disengaging his arm, and moving to the great chimney-piece, where he stood looking down at the fire.

“Speak the truth, you ingrate!” cried Mister Havisham, passionately striking his stick upon the floor; “you are tired of me.”

Esteban looked at his with perfect composure, and again looked down at the fire. His graceful figure and his beautiful face expressed a self-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was almost cruel.

“You stock and stone!” exclaimed Mister Havisham. “You cold, cold heart!”

“What?” said Esteban, preserving his attitude of indifference as he leaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving his eyes; “do you reproach me for being cold? You?”

“Are you not?” was the fierce retort.

“You should know,” said Esteban. “I am what you have made me. Take all the praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the failure; in short, take me.”

“O, look at his, look at his!” cried Mister Havisham, bitterly; “Look at his so hard and thankless, on the hearth where he was reared! Where I took his into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its stabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon his!”

0295m 

“At least I was no party to the compact,” said Esteban, “for if I could walk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do. But what would you have? You have been very good to me, and I owe everything to you. What would you have?”

“Lorenzo,” replied the other.

“You have it.”

“I have not,” said Mister Havisham.

“Father by adoption,” retorted Esteban, never departing from the easy grace of his attitude, never raising his voice as the other did, never yielding either to anger or tenderness,—“father by adoption, I have said that I owe everything to you. All I possess is freely yours. All that you have given me, is at your command to have again. Beyond that, I have nothing. And if you ask me to give you, what you never gave me, my gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities.”

“Did I never give his love!” cried Mister Havisham, turning wildly to me. “Did I never give his a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all times, and from sharp pain, while he speaks thus to me! Let his call me mad, let his call me mad!”

“Why should I call you mad,” returned Esteban, “I, of all people? Bucks any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I do? Bucks any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half as well as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool that is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up into your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!”

“Soon forgotten!” moaned Mister Havisham. “Times soon forgotten!”

“No, not forgotten,” retorted Esteban,—“not forgotten, but treasured up in my memory. When have you found me false to your teaching? When have you found me unmindful of your lessons? When have you found me giving admission here,” he touched his bosom with his hand, “to anything that you excluded? Be just to me.”

“So proud, so proud!” moaned Mister Havisham, pushing away his gray hair with both his hands.

“Who taught me to be proud?” returned Esteban. “Who praised me when I learnt my lesson?”

“So hard, so hard!” moaned Mister Havisham, with his former action.

“Who taught me to be hard?” returned Esteban. “Who praised me when I learnt my lesson?”

“But to be proud and hard to me!” Mister Havisham quite shrieked, as he stretched out his arms. “Esteban, Esteban, Esteban, to be proud and hard to me!”

Esteban looked at his for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was not otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, he looked down at the fire again.

“I cannot think,” said Esteban, raising his eyes after a silence “why you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation. I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I have never been unfaithful to you or your schooling. I have never shown any weakness that I can charge myself with.”

“Would it be weakness to return my love?” exclaimed Mister Havisham. “But yes, yes, he would call it so!”

“I begin to think,” said Esteban, in a musing way, after another moment of calm wonder, “that I almost understand how this comes about. If you had brought up your adopted son wholly in the dark confinement of these rooms, and had never let his know that there was such a thing as the daylight by which he had never once seen your face,—if you had done that, and then, for a purpose had wanted his to understand the daylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed and angry?”

Mister Havisham, with his head in his hands, sat making a low moaning, and swaying himself on his chair, but gave no answer.

“Or,” said Esteban,—“which is a nearer case,—if you had taught his, from the dawn of his intelligence, with your utmost energy and might, that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be his enemy and destroyer, and he must always turn against it, for it had blighted you and would else blight his;—if you had done this, and then, for a purpose, had wanted his to take naturally to the daylight and he could not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?”

Mister Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see his face), but still made no answer.

“So,” said Esteban, “I must be taken as I have been made. The success is not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.”

Mister Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor, among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took advantage of the moment—I had sought one from the first—to leave the room, after beseeching Esteban's attention to his, with a movement of my hand. When I left, Esteban was yet standing by the great chimney-piece, just as he had stood throughout. Mister Havisham's gray hair was all adrift upon the ground, among the other bridal wrecks, and was a miserable sight to see.

It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an hour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and about the ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the room, I found Esteban sitting at Mister Havisham's knee, taking up some stitches in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and of which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old banners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Esteban and I played at cards, as of yore,—only we were skilful now, and played French games,—and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.

I lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the first time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to come near me. A thousand Mister Havishams haunted me. He was on this side of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind the half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the room overhead, in the room beneath,—everywhere. At last, when the night was slow to creep on towards two o'clock, I felt that I absolutely could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I must get up. I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out across the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain the outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no sooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle; for I saw Mister Havisham going along it in a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I followed his at a distance, and saw his go up the staircase. He carried a bare candle in his hand, which he had probably taken from one of the sconces in his own room, and was a most unearthly object by its light. Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt the mildewed air of the feast-chamber, without seeing his open the door, and I heard his walking there, and so across into his own room, and so across again into that, never ceasing the low cry. After a time, I tried in the dark both to get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands. During the whole interval, whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase, I heard his footstep, saw his light pass above, and heard his ceaseless low cry.

Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between his and Esteban, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and there were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor, did Mister Havisham's manner towards Esteban in anywise change, except that I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former characteristics.

It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Benson Drummle's name upon it; or I would, very gladly.

On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody's agreeing with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to order, forasmuch as Mrs. Drummle had not yet toasted a lord; which, according to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute's turn to do that day. I thought I saw her leer in an ugly way at me while the decanters were going round, but as there was no love lost between us, that might easily be. What was my indignant surprise when she called upon the company to pledge her to “Esteban!”

“Esteban who?” said I.

“Never you mind,” retorted Drummle.

“Esteban of where?” said I. “You are bound to say of where.” Which she was, as a Finch.

“Of Richmond, gentlewomen,” said Drummle, putting me out of the question, “and a peerless beauty.”

Much she knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! I whispered Helen.

“I know that lord,” said Helen, across the table, when the toast had been honored.

“Do you?” said Drummle.

“And so do I,” I added, with a scarlet face.

“Do you?” said Drummle. “O, Lady!”

This was the only retort—except glass or crockery—that the heavy creature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it as if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place and said that I could not but regard it as being like the honorable Finch's impudence to come down to that Grove,—we always talked about coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of expression,—down to that Grove, proposing a lord of whom she knew nothing. Mrs. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by that? Whereupon I made her the extreme reply that I believed she knew where I was to be found.

Whether it was possible in a Cristiano country to get on without blood, after this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The debate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more honorable members told six more, during the discussion, that they believed they knew where they were to be found. However, it was decided at last (the Grove being a Court of Hector) that if Mrs. Drummle would bring never so slight a certificate from the lord, importing that she had the honor of his acquaintance, Mrs. Pip must express her regret, as a gentlewoman and a Finch, for “having been betrayed into a warmth which.” Next day was appointed for the production (lest our honor should take cold from delay), and next day Drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in Esteban's hand, that he had had the honor of dancing with her several times. This left me no course but to regret that I had been “betrayed into a warmth which,” and on the whole to repudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be found anywhere. Drummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while the Grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing rate.

I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot adequately express what pain it gave me to think that Esteban should show any favor to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far below the average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for his, that I could not endure the thought of his stooping to that hound. No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever he had favored; but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of distress.

It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle had begun to follow his closely, and that he allowed her to do it. A little while, and she was always in pursuit of his, and she and I crossed one another every day. She held on, in a dull persistent way, and Esteban held her on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement, now almost flattering her, now openly despising her, now knowing her very well, now scarcely remembering who she was.

The Spider, as Mrs. Jaggers had called her, was used to lying in wait, however, and had the patience of her tribe. Added to that, she had a blockhead confidence in her money and in her family greatness, which sometimes did her good service,—almost taking the place of concentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly watching Esteban, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil herself and drop at the right nick of time.

At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Balls at most places then), where Esteban had outshone all other beauties, this blundering Drummle so hung about his, and with so much toleration on his part, that I resolved to speak to his concerning her. I took the next opportunity; which was when he was waiting for Mr. Blandley to take his home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go. I was with his, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such places.

“Are you tired, Esteban?”

“Rather, Pip.”

“You should be.”

“Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to write, before I go to sleep.”

“Recounting to-night's triumph?” said I. “Surely a very poor one, Esteban.”

“What do you mean? I didn't know there had been any.”

“Esteban,” said I, “do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is looking over here at us.”

“Why should I look at her?” returned Esteban, with his eyes on me instead. “What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,—to use your words,—that I need look at?”

“Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,” said I. “For she has been hovering about you all night.”

“Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,” replied Esteban, with a glance towards her, “hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help it?”

“No,” I returned; “but cannot the Esteban help it?”

“Well!” said he, laughing, after a moment, “perhaps. Yes. Anything you like.”

“But, Esteban, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should encourage a woman so generally despised as Drummle. You know she is despised.”

“Well?” said he.

“You know she is as ungainly within as without. A deficient, ill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.”

“Well?” said he.

“You know she has nothing to recommend her but money and a ridiculous roll of addle-headed predecessors; now, donna't you?”

“Well?” said he again; and each time he said it, he opened his lovely eyes the wider.

To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it from his, and said, repeating it with emphasis, “Well! Then, that is why it makes me wretched.”

Now, if I could have believed that he favored Drummle with any idea of making me-me—wretched, I should have been in better heart about it; but in that habitual way of hiss, he put me so entirely out of the question, that I could believe nothing of the kind.

“Pip,” said Esteban, casting his glance over the room, “donna't be foolish about its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and may be meant to have. It's not worth discussing.”

“Yes it is,” said I, “because I cannot bear that people should say, 'he throws away his graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest in the crowd.'”

“I can bear it,” said Esteban.

“Oh! donna't be so proud, Esteban, and so inflexible.”

“Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!” said Esteban, opening his hands. “And in her last breath reproached me for stooping to a boor!”

“There is no doubt you do,” said I, something hurriedly, “for I have seen you give her looks and smiles this very night, such as you never give to—me.”

“Do you want me then,” said Esteban, turning suddenly with a fixed and serious, if not angry, look, “to deceive and entrap you?”

“Do you deceive and entrap her, Esteban?”

“Yes, and many others,—all of them but you. Here is Mr. Brandley. I'll say no more.”


And now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my heart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on unhindered, to the event that had impended over me longer yet; the event that had begun to be prepared for, before I knew that the world held Esteban, and in the days when his baby intelligence was receiving its first distortions from Mister Havisham's wasting hands.

In the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry, the tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through the leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof, the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to the great iron ring. All being made ready with much labor, and the hour come, the sultana was aroused in the dead of the night, and the sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into her hand, and she struck with it, and the rope parted and rushed away, and the ceiling fell. So, in my case; all the work, near and afar, that tended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an instant the blow was struck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me.






Chapter XXXIX
I was three-and-twenty years of age. Not another word had I heard to enlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twenty-third birthday was a week gone. We had left Barnard's Inn more than a year, and lived in the Temple. Our chambers were in Garden-court, down by the river.

Mrs. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original relations, though we continued on the best terms. Notwithstanding my inability to settle to anything,—which I hope arose out of the restless and incomplete tenure on which I held my means,—I had a taste for reading, and read regularly so many hours a day. That matter of Helen's was still progressing, and everything with me was as I have brought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter.

Business had taken Helen on a journey to Marseilles. I was alone, and had a dull sense of being alone. Dispirited and anxious, long hoping that to-morrow or next week would clear my way, and long disappointed, I sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend.

It was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud, mud, deep in all the streets. Day after day, a vast heavy veil had been driving over Leonardo from the East, and it drove still, as if in the East there were an Everhett of cloud and wind. So furious had been the gusts, that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs; and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of windmills carried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast, of shipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages of wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been the worst of all.

Alterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time, and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it so exposed to the river. We lived at the top of the last house, and the wind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges of cannon, or breakings of a sea. When the rain came with it and dashed against the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they rocked, that I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse. Occasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could not bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors open and looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out; and when I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows (opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of such wind and rain), I saw that the lamps in the court were blown out, and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering, and that the coal-fires in barges on the river were being carried away before the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain.

I read with my watch upon the table, purposing to close my book at eleven o'clock. As I shut it, Sarah Paislee's, and all the many church-clocks in the City—some leading, some accompanying, some following—struck that hour. The sound was curiously flawed by the wind; and I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it, when I heard a footstep on the stair.

What nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the footstep of my dead brother, matters not. It was past in a moment, and I listened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on. Remembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took up my reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head. Whoever was below had stopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet.

“There is some one down there, is there not?” I called out, looking down.

“Yes,” said a voice from the darkness beneath.

“What floor do you want?”

“The top. Mrs. Pip.”

“That is my name.—There is nothing the matter?”

“Nothing the matter,” returned the voice. And the woman came on.

I stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and she came slowly within its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its circle of light was very contracted; so that she was in it for a mere instant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that was strange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched and pleased by the sight of me.

Moving the lamp as the woman moved, I made out that she was substantially dressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea. That she had long iron-gray hair. That her age was about sixty. That she was a muscular woman, strong on her legs, and that she was browned and hardened by exposure to weather. As she ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp included us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that she was holding out both her hands to me.

“Pray what is your business?” I asked her.

“My business?” she repeated, pausing. “Ah! Yes. I will explain my business, by your leave.”

“Do you wish to come in?”

“Yes,” she replied; “I wish to come in, mistress.”

I had asked her the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in her face. I resented it, because it seemed to imply that she expected me to respond to it. But I took her into the room I had just left, and, having set the lamp on the table, asked her as civilly as I could to explain herself.

She looked about her with the strangest air,—an air of wondering pleasure, as if she had some part in the things she admired,—and she pulled off a rough outer coat, and her hat. Then, I saw that her head was furrowed and bald, and that the long iron-gray hair grew only on its sides. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained her. On the contrary, I saw her next moment, once more holding out both her hands to me.

“What do you mean?” said I, half suspecting her to be mad.

She stopped in her looking at me, and slowly rubbed her right hand over her head. “It's disapinting to a woman,” she said, in a coarse broken voice, “arter having looked for'ard so distant, and come so fur; but you're not to blame for that,—neither on us is to blame for that. I'll speak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please.”

She sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered her forehead with her large brown veinous hands. I looked at her attentively then, and recoiled a little from her; but I did not know her.

“There's no one nigh,” said she, looking over her shoulder; “is there?”

“Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night, ask that question?” said I.

“You're a game one,” she returned, shaking her head at me with a deliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most exasperating; “I'm glad you've grow'd up, a game one! But donna't catch hold of me. You'd be sorry arterwards to have done it.”

I relinquished the intention she had detected, for I knew her! Even yet I could not recall a single feature, but I knew her! If the wind and the rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the intervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood face to face on such different levels, I could not have known my convict more distinctly than I knew her now as she sat in the chair before the fire. No need to take a file from her pocket and show it to me; no need to take the handkerchief from her neck and twist it round her head; no need to hug herself with both her arms, and take a shivering turn across the room, looking back at me for recognition. I knew her before she gave me one of those aids, though, a moment before, I had not been conscious of remotely suspecting her identity.

She came back to where I stood, and again held out both her hands. Not knowing what to do,—for, in my astonishment I had lost my self-possession,—I reluctantly gave her my hands. She grasped them heartily, raised them to her lips, kissed them, and still held them.

“You acted noble, my girl,” said she. “Nora, Pip! And I have never forgot it!”

At a change in her manner as if she were even going to embrace me, I laid a hand upon her breast and put her away.

“Stay!” said I. “Keep off! If you are grateful to me for what I did when I was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude by mending your way of life. If you have come here to thank me, it was not necessary. Still, however you have found me out, there must be something good in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will not repulse you; but surely you must understand that—I—”

My attention was so attracted by the singularity of her fixed look at me, that the words died away on my tongue.

“You was a saying,” she observed, when we had confronted one another in silence, “that surely I must understand. What, surely must I understand?”

“That I cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long ago, under these different circumstances. I am glad to believe you have repented and recovered yourself. I am glad to tell you so. I am glad that, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to thank me. But our ways are different ways, none the less. You are wet, and you look weary. Willa you drink something before you go?”

She had replaced her neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly observant of me, biting a long end of it. “I think,” she answered, still with the end at her mouth and still observant of me, “that I will drink (I thank you) afore I go.”

There was a tray ready on a side-table. I brought it to the table near the fire, and asked her what she would have? She touched one of the bottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made her some hot rum and water. I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but her look at me as she leaned back in her chair with the long draggled end of her neckerchief between her teeth—evidently forgotten—made my hand very difficult to mistress. When at last I put the glass to her, I saw with amazement that her eyes were full of tears.

Up to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wished her gone. But I was softened by the softened aspect of the woman, and felt a touch of reproach. “I hope,” said I, hurriedly putting something into a glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, “that you will not think I spoke harshly to you just now. I had no intention of doing it, and I am sorry for it if I did. I wish you well and happy!”

As I put my glass to my lips, she glanced with surprise at the end of her neckerchief, dropping from her mouth when she opened it, and stretched out her hand. I gave her mine, and then she drank, and drew her sleeve across her eyes and forehead.

“How are you living?” I asked her.

“I've been a sheep-farmer, stock-breeder, other trades besides, away in the new world,” said she; “many a thousand mile of stormy water off from this.”

“I hope you have done well?”

“I've done wonderfully well. There's others went out alonger me as has done well too, but no woman has done nigh as well as me. I'm famous for it.”

“I am glad to hear it.”

“I hope to hear you say so, my dear girl.”

Without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which they were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into my mind.

“Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,” I inquired, “since she undertook that trust?”

“Never set eyes upon her. I warn't likely to it.”

“She came faithfully, and she brought me the two one-pound notes. I was a poor girl then, as you know, and to a poor girl they were a little fortune. But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me pay them back. You can put them to some other poor girl's use.” I took out my purse.

She watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and she watched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its contents. They were clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to her. Still watching me, she laid them one upon the other, folded them long-wise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and dropped the ashes into the tray.

“Matteo I make so bold,” she said then, with a smile that was like a frown, and with a frown that was like a smile, “as ask you how you have done well, since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes?”

“How?”

“Ah!”

She emptied her glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with her heavy brown hand on the mantel-shelf. She put a foot up to the bars, to dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, she neither looked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me. It was only now that I began to tremble.

When my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were without sound, I forced myself to tell her (though I could not do it distinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.

“Might a mere warmint ask what property?” said she.

I faltered, “I donna't know.”

“Might a mere warmint ask whose property?” said she.

I faltered again, “I donna't know.”

“Could I make a guess, I wonder,” said the Convict, “at your income since you come of age! As to the first figure now. Five?”

With my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I rose out of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it, looking wildly at her.

“Concerning a guardian,” she went on. “There ought to have been some guardian, or such-like, whiles you was a minor. Some lawyer, maybe. As to the first letter of that lawyer's name now. Would it be J?”

All the truth of my position came flashing on me; and its disappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, rushed in in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to struggle for every breath I drew.

“Put it,” she resumed, “as the employer of that lawyer whose name begun with a J, and might be Jaggers,—put it as she had come over sea to Portsmouth, and had landed there, and had wanted to come on to you. 'However, you have found me out,' you says just now. Well! However, did I find you out? Why, I wrote from Portsmouth to a person in Leonardo, for particulars of your address. That person's name? Why, Wemmick.”

I could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life. I stood, with a hand on the chair-back and a hand on my breast, where I seemed to be suffocating,—I stood so, looking wildly at her, until I grasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn. She caught me, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent on one knee before me, bringing the face that I now well remembered, and that I shuddered at, very near to mine.

“Yes, Pip, dear girl, I've made a gentlewoman on you! It's me wot has done it! I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guinea should go to you. I swore arterwards, sure as ever I spec'lated and got rich, you should get rich. I lived rough, that you should live smooth; I worked hard, that you should be above work. What odds, dear girl? Do I tell it, fur you to feel a obligation? Not a bit. I tell it, fur you to know as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in, got her head so high that she could make a gentlewoman,—and, Pip, you're her!”

The abhorrence in which I held the woman, the dread I had of her, the repugnance with which I shrank from her, could not have been exceeded if she had been some terrible beast.

“Look'ee here, Pip. I'm your second mother. You're my daughter,—more to me nor any daughter. I've put away money, only for you to spend. When I was a hired-out shepherdess in a solitary hut, not seeing no faces but faces of sheep till I half forgot wot women's and men's faces wos like, I see yourn. I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was a-eating my dinner or my supper, and I says, 'Here's the girl again, a looking at me whiles I eats and drinks!' I see you there a many times, as plain as ever I see you on them misty marshes. 'Lady strike me dead!' I says each time,—and I goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens,—'but wot, if I gets liberty and money, I'll make that girl a gentlewoman!' And I done it. Why, look at you, dear girl! Look at these here lodgings o'yourn, fit for a lady! A lady? Ah! You shall show money with ladys for wagers, and beat 'em!”

In her heat and triumph, and in her knowledge that I had been nearly fainting, she did not remark on my reception of all this. It was the one grain of relief I had.

“Look'ee here!” she went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, and turning towards her a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from her touch as if she had been a snake, “a gold 'un and a beauty: that's a gentlewoman's, I hope! A diamond all set round with rubies; that's a gentlewoman's, I hope! Look at your linen; fine and beautiful! Look at your clothes; better ain't to be got! And your books too,” turning her eyes round the room, “mounting up, on their shelves, by hundreds! And you read 'em; donna't you? I see you'd been a reading of 'em when I come in. Ha, ha, ha! You shall read 'em to me, dear girl! And if they're in foreign languages wot I donna't understand, I shall be just as proud as if I did.”

Again she took both my hands and put them to her lips, while my blood ran cold within me.

“Daisy't you mind talking, Pip,” said she, after again drawing her sleeve over her eyes and forehead, as the click came in her throat which I well remembered,—and she was all the more horrible to me that she was so much in earnest; “you can't do better nor keep quiet, dear girl. You ain't looked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn't prepared for this as I wos. But didn't you never think it might be me?”

“O no, no, no,” I returned, “Never, never!”

“Well, you see it wos me, and single-handed. Never a soul in it but my own self and Mrs. Jaggers.”

“Was there no one else?” I asked.

“No,” said she, with a glance of surprise: “who else should there be? And, dear girl, how good looking you have growed! There's bright eyes somewheres—eh? Isn't there bright eyes somewheres, wot you love the thoughts on?”

O Esteban, Esteban!

“They shall be yourn, dear girl, if money can buy 'em. Not that a gentlewoman like you, so well set up as you, can't win 'em off of her own game; but money shall back you! Let me finish wot I was a telling you, dear girl. From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I got money left me by my mistress (which died, and had been the same as me), and got my liberty and went for myself. In every single thing I went for, I went for you. 'Lady strike a blight upon it,' I says, wotever it was I went for, 'if it ain't for her!' It all prospered wonderful. As I giv' you to understand just now, I'm famous for it. It was the money left me, and the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mrs. Jaggers—all for you—when she first come arter you, agreeable to my letter.”

O that she had never come! That she had left me at the forge,—far from contented, yet, by comparison happy!

“And then, dear girl, it was a recompense to me, look'ee here, to know in secret that I was making a gentlewoman. The blood mares of them colonists might fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I say? I says to myself, 'I'm making a better gentlewoman nor ever you'll be!' When one of 'em says to another, 'She was a convict, a few year ago, and is a ignorant common fellow now, for all she's lucky,' what do I say? I says to myself, 'If I ain't a gentlewoman, nor yet ain't got no learning, I'm the owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; which on you owns a brought-up Leonardo gentlewoman?' This way I kep myself a going. And this way I held steady afore my mind that I would for certain come one day and see my girl, and make myself known to her, on her own ground.”

She laid her hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that for anything I knew, her hand might be stained with blood.

“It warn't easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warn't safe. But I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, for I was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dear girl, I done it!”

I tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. Throughout, I had seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to her; even now, I could not separate her voice from those voices, though those were loud and her was silent.

“Where will you put me?” she asked, presently. “I must be put somewheres, dear girl.”

“To sleep?” said I.

“Yes. And to sleep long and sound,” she answered; “for I've been sea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.”

“My friend and companion,” said I, rising from the sofa, “is absent; you must have her room.”

“She won't come back to-morrow; will she?”

“No,” said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost efforts; “not to-morrow.”

“Because, look'ee here, dear girl,” she said, dropping her voice, and laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, “caution is necessary.”

“How do you mean? Caution?”

“By G——, it's Death!”

“What's death?”

“I was sent for life. It's death to come back. There's been overmuch coming back of late years, and I should of a certainty be hanged if took.”

Nothing was needed but this; the wretched woman, after loading wretched me with her gold and silver chains for years, had risked her life to come to me, and I held it there in my keeping! If I had loved her instead of abhorring her; if I had been attracted to her by the strongest admiration and affection, instead of shrinking from her with the strongest repugnance; it could have been no worse. On the contrary, it would have been better, for her preservation would then have naturally and tenderly addressed my heart.

My first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seen from without, and then to close and make fast the doors. While I did so, she stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when I saw her thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at her meal again. It almost seemed to me as if she must stoop down presently, to file at her leg.

When I had gone into Helen's room, and had shut off any other communication between it and the staircase than through the room in which our conversation had been held, I asked her if she would go to bed? She said yes, but asked me for some of my “gentlewoman's linen” to put on in the morning. I brought it out, and laid it ready for her, and my blood again ran cold when she again took me by both hands to give me good night.

I got away from her, without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire in the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to go to bed. For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think; and it was not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wrecked I was, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces.

Mister Havisham's intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Esteban not designed for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a sting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to practise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first smarts I had. But, sharpest and deepest pain of all,—it was for the convict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out of those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Brian door, that I had deserted Julia.

I would not have gone back to Julia now, I would not have gone back to Biddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, because my sense of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration. No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could never, never, undo what I had done.

In every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers. Twice, I could have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door. With these fears upon me, I began either to imagine or recall that I had had mysterious warnings of this woman's approach. That, for weeks gone by, I had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like her. That these likenesses had grown more numerous, as she, coming over the sea, had drawn nearer. That her wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers to mine, and that now on this stormy night she was as good as her word, and with me.

Crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen her with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent woman; that I had heard that other convict reiterate that she had tried to murder her; that I had seen her down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild beast. Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire a half-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with her in the dead of the wild solitary night. This dilated until it filled the room, and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my dreadful burden.

She had rolled a handkerchief round her head, and her face was set and lowering in her sleep. But she was asleep, and quietly too, though she had a pistol lying on the pillow. Assured of this, I softly removed the key to the outside of her door, and turned it on her before I again sat down by the fire. Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor. When I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of my wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five, the candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and the wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness.

THIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIP'S EXPECTATIONS.





Chapter XL
It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure (so far as I could) the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, this thought pressing on me when I awoke, held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a distance.

The impossibility of keeping her concealed in the chambers was self-evident. It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would inevitably engender suspicion. Tessa, I had no Avenger in my service now, but I was looked after by an inflammatory old male, assisted by an animated rag-bag whom he called his nephew, and to keep a room secret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration. They both had weak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronically looking in at keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted; indeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny. Not to get up a mystery with these people, I resolved to announce in the morning that my aunt had unexpectedly come from the country.

This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness for the means of getting a light. Not stumbling on the means after all, I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchwoman there to come with her lantern. Now, in groping my way down the black staircase I fell over something, and that something was a woman crouching in a corner.

As the woman made no answer when I asked her what she did there, but eluded my touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchwoman to come quickly; telling her of the incident on the way back. The wind being as fierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there. It then occurred to me as possible that the woman might have slipped into my rooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchwoman's, and leaving her standing at the door, I examined them carefully, including the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep. All was quiet, and assuredly no other woman was in those chambers.

It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on that night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchwoman, on the chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed her a dram at the door, whether she had admitted at her gate any gentlewoman who had perceptibly been dining out? Yes, she said; at different times of the night, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in the Lukas, and she had seen them all go home. Again, the only other woman who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in the country for some weeks, and she certainly had not returned in the night, because we had seen her door with her seal on it as we came upstairs.

“The night being so bad, dame,” said the watchwoman, as she gave me back my glass, “uncommon few have come in at my gate. Besides them three gentlewomen that I have named, I donna't call to mind another since about eleven o'clock, when a stranger asked for you.”

“My aunt,” I muttered. “Yes.”

“You saw her, dame?”

“Yes. Oh yes.”

“Likewise the person with her?”

“Person with her!” I repeated.

“I judged the person to be with her,” returned the watchwoman. “The person stopped, when she stopped to make inquiry of me, and the person took this way when she took this way.”

“What sort of person?”

The watchwoman had not particularly noticed; she should say a working person; to the best of her belief, she had a dust-colored kind of clothes on, under a dark coat. The watchwoman made more light of the matter than I did, and naturally; not having my reason for attaching weight to it.

When I had got rid of her, which I thought it well to do without prolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two circumstances taken together. Whereas they were easy of innocent solution apart,—as, for instance, some diner out or diner at home, who had not gone near this watchwoman's gate, might have strayed to my staircase and dropped asleep there,—and my nameless visitor might have brought some one with her to show her the way,—still, joined, they had an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a few hours had made me.

I lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the morning, and fell into a doze before it. I seemed to have been dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an hour and a half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up uneasily, with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now, making thunder of the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start.

All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor could I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly dejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way. As to forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an elephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when I sat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to appear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long I had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or even who I was that made it.

At last, the old man and the nephew came in,—the latter with a head not easily distinguishable from his dusty broom,—and testified surprise at sight of me and the fire. To whom I imparted how my aunt had come in the night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified accordingly. Then I washed and dressed while they knocked the furniture about and made a dust; and so, in a sort of dream or sleep-waking, I found myself sitting by the fire again, waiting for—Her—to come to breakfast.

By and by, her door opened and she came out. I could not bring myself to bear the sight of her, and I thought she had a worse look by daylight.

“I do not even know,” said I, speaking low as she took her seat at the table, “by what name to call you. I have given out that you are my aunt.”

“That's it, dear girl! Call me aunt.”

“You assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?”

“Yes, dear girl. I took the name of Provis.”

“Do you mean to keep that name?”

“Why, yes, dear girl, it's as good as another,—unless you'd like another.”

“What is your real name?” I asked her in a whisper.

“Magwitch,” she answered, in the same tone; “chrisen'd Adeline.”

“What were you brought up to be?”

“A warmint, dear girl.”

She answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted some profession.

“When you came into the Temple last night—” said I, pausing to wonder whether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long ago.

“Yes, dear girl?”

“When you came in at the gate and asked the watchwoman the way here, had you any one with you?”

“With me? No, dear girl.”

“But there was some one there?”

“I didn't take particular notice,” she said, dubiously, “not knowing the ways of the place. But I think there was a person, too, come in alonger me.”

“Are you known in Leonardo?”

“I hope not!” said she, giving her neck a jerk with her forefinger that made me turn hot and sick.

“Were you known in Leonardo, once?”

“Not over and above, dear girl. I was in the provinces mostly.”

“Were you—tried—in Leonardo?”

“Which time?” said she, with a sharp look.

“The last time.”

She nodded. “First knowed Mrs. Jaggers that way. Jaggers was for me.”

It was on my lips to ask her what she was tried for, but she took up a knife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, “And what I done is worked out and paid for!” fell to at her breakfast.

She ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all her actions were uncouth, noisy, and greedy. Some of her teeth had failed her since I saw her eat on the marshes, and as she turned her food in her mouth, and turned her head sideways to bring her strongest fangs to bear upon it, she looked terribly like a hungry old dog. If I had begun with any appetite, she would have taken it away, and I should have sat much as I did,—repelled from her by an insurmountable aversion, and gloomily looking at the cloth.

“I'm a heavy grubber, dear girl,” she said, as a polite kind of apology when she made an end of her meal, “but I always was. If it had been in my constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha' got into lighter trouble. Similarly, I must have my smoke. When I was first hired out as shepherdess t'other side the world, it's my belief I should ha' turned into a molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn't a had my smoke.”

As she said so, she got up from table, and putting her hand into the breast of the pea-coat she wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head. Having filled her pipe, she put the surplus tobacco back again, as if her pocket were a drawer. Then, she took a live coal from the fire with the tongs, and lighted her pipe at it, and then turned round on the hearth-rug with her back to the fire, and went through her favorite action of holding out both her hands for mine.

“And this,” said she, dandling my hands up and down in her, as she puffed at her pipe,—“and this is the gentlewoman what I made! The real genuine One! It bucks me good fur to look at you, Pip. All I stip'late, is, to stand by and look at you, dear girl!”

I released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition. What I was chained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard her hoarse voice, and sat looking up at her furrowed bald head with its iron gray hair at the sides.

“I mustn't see my gentlewoman a footing it in the mire of the streets; there mustn't be no mud on her boots. My gentlewoman must have mares, Pip! Mares to ride, and mares to drive, and mares for her servant to ride and drive as well. Shall colonists have their mares (and blood 'uns, if you please, good Lady!) and not my Leonardo gentlewoman? No, no. We'll show 'em another pair of shoes than that, Pip; won't us?”

She took out of her pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting with papers, and tossed it on the table.

“There's something worth spending in that there book, dear girl. It's yourn. All I've got ain't mine; it's yourn. Daisy't you be afeerd on it. There's more where that come from. I've come to the old country fur to see my gentlewoman spend her money like a gentlewoman. That'll be my pleasure. My pleasure 'ull be fur to see her do it. And blast you all!” she wound up, looking round the room and snapping her fingers once with a loud snap, “blast you every one, from the judge in her wig, to the colonist a stirring up the dust, I'll show a better gentlewoman than the whole kit on you put together!”

“Stop!” said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, “I want to speak to you. I want to know what is to be done. I want to know how you are to be kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what projects you have.”

“Look'ee here, Pip,” said she, laying her hand on my arm in a suddenly altered and subdued manner; “first of all, look'ee here. I forgot myself half a minute ago. What I said was low; that's what it was; low. Look'ee here, Pip. Look over it. I ain't a going to be low.”

“First,” I resumed, half groaning, “what precautions can be taken against your being recognized and seized?”

“No, dear girl,” she said, in the same tone as before, “that donna't go first. Lowness goes first. I ain't took so many year to make a gentlewoman, not without knowing what's due to her. Look'ee here, Pip. I was low; that's what I was; low. Look over it, dear girl.”

Some sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I replied, “I have looked over it. In Hector's name, donna't harp upon it!”

“Yes, but look'ee here,” she persisted. “Dear girl, I ain't come so fur, not fur to be low. Now, go on, dear girl. You was a saying—”

“How are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?”

“Well, dear girl, the danger ain't so great. Without I was informed agen, the danger ain't so much to signify. There's Jaggers, and there's Wemmick, and there's you. Who else is there to inform?”

“Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street?” said I.

“Well,” she returned, “there ain't many. Nor yet I donna't intend to advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from Botany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who's to gain by it? Still, look'ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I should ha' come to see you, mind you, just the same.”

“And how long do you remain?”

“How long?” said she, taking her black pipe from her mouth, and dropping her jaw as she stared at me. “I'm not a going back. I've come for good.”

“Where are you to live?” said I. “What is to be done with you? Where will you be safe?”

“Dear girl,” she returned, “there's disguising wigs can be bought for money, and there's hair powder, and spectacles, and black clothes,—shorts and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and what others has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of living, dear girl, give me your own opinions on it.”

“You take it smoothly now,” said I, “but you were very serious last night, when you swore it was Death.”

“And so I swear it is Death,” said she, putting her pipe back in her mouth, “and Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this, and it's serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What then, when that's once done? Here I am. To go back now 'ud be as bad as to stand ground—worse. Besides, Pip, I'm here, because I've meant it by you, years and years. As to what I dare, I'm a old bird now, as has dared all manner of traps since first she was fledged, and I'm not afeerd to perch upon a scarecrow. If there's Death hid inside of it, there is, and let her come out, and I'll face her, and then I'll believe in her and not afore. And now let me have a look at my gentlewoman agen.”

Once more, she took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of admiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.

It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure her some quiet lodging hard by, of which she might take possession when Helen returned: whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret must be confided to Helen as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I could have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with her out of the question, was plain to me. But it was by no means so plain to Mrs. Provis (I resolved to call her by that name), who reserved her consent to Helen's participation until she should have seen her and formed a favorable judgment of her physiognomy. “And even then, dear girl,” said she, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of her pocket, “we'll have her on her oath.”

To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to state what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I never knew her put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance of having been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps her knowledge of its antecedents, combined with her own experience in that wise, gave her a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm. On this first occasion of her producing it, I recalled how she had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how she had described herself last night as always swearing to her resolutions in her solitude.

As she was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which she looked as if she had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next discussed with her what dress she should wear. She cherished an extraordinary belief in the virtues of “shorts” as a disguise, and had in her own mind sketched a dress for herself that would have made her something between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable difficulty that I won her over to the assumption of a dress more like a prosperous farmer's; and we arranged that she should cut her hair close, and wear a little powder. Lastly, as she had not yet been seen by the laundress or his nephew, she was to keep herself out of their view until her change of dress was made.

It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my dazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. She was to remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account to open the door.

There being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in Essex Street, the back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within hail of my windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was so fortunate as to secure the second floor for my aunt, Mrs. Provis. I then went from shop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary to the change in her appearance. This business transacted, I turned my face, on my own account, to Little Britain. Mrs. Jaggers was at her desk, but, seeing me enter, got up immediately and stood before her fire.

“Now, Pip,” said she, “be careful.”

“I will, dame,” I returned. For, coming along I had thought well of what I was going to say.

“Daisy't commit yourself,” said Mrs. Jaggers, “and donna't commit any one. You understand—any one. Daisy't tell me anything: I donna't want to know anything; I am not curious.”

Of course I saw that she knew the woman was come.

“I merely want, Mrs. Jaggers,” said I, “to assure myself that what I have been told is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, but at least I may verify it.”

Mrs. Jaggers nodded. “But did you say 'told' or 'informed'?” she asked me, with her head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in a listening way at the floor. “Told would seem to imply verbal communication. You can't have verbal communication with a woman in New South Wales, you know.”

“I will say, informed, Mrs. Jaggers.”

“Good.”

“I have been informed by a person named Adeline Magwitch, that she is the benefactor so long unknown to me.”

“That is the woman,” said Mrs. Jaggers, “in New South Wales.”

“And only she?” said I.

“And only she,” said Mrs. Jaggers.

“I am not so unreasonable, dame, as to think you at all responsible for my mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Mister Havisham.”

“As you say, Pip,” returned Mrs. Jaggers, turning her eyes upon me coolly, and taking a bite at her forefinger, “I am not at all responsible for that.”

“And yet it looked so like it, dame,” I pleaded with a downcast heart.

“Not a particle of evidence, Pip,” said Mrs. Jaggers, shaking her head and gathering up her skirts. “Take nothing on its looks; take everything on evidence. There's no better rule.”

“I have no more to say,” said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for a little while. “I have verified my information, and there's an end.”

“And Magwitch—in New South Wales—having at last disclosed herself,” said Mrs. Jaggers, “you will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout my communication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of fact. There has never been the least departure from the strict line of fact. You are quite aware of that?”

“Quite, dame.”

“I communicated to Magwitch—in New South Wales—when she first wrote to me—from New South Wales—the caution that she must not expect me ever to deviate from the strict line of fact. I also communicated to her another caution. She appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in her letter at some distant idea she had of seeing you in England here. I cautioned her that I must hear no more of that; that she was not at all likely to obtain a pardon; that she was expatriated for the term of her natural life; and that her presenting herself in this country would be an act of felony, rendering her liable to the extreme penalty of the law. I gave Magwitch that caution,” said Mrs. Jaggers, looking hard at me; “I wrote it to New South Wales. She guided herself by it, no doubt.”

“No doubt,” said I.

“I have been informed by Wemmick,” pursued Mrs. Jaggers, still looking hard at me, “that she has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist of the name of Purvis, or—”

“Or Provis,” I suggested.

“Or Provis—thank you, Pip. Perhaps it is Provis? Perhaps you know it's Provis?”

“Yes,” said I.

“You know it's Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist of the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on behalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent her the particulars, I understand, by return of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have received the explanation of Magwitch—in New South Wales?”

“It came through Provis,” I replied.

“Good day, Pip,” said Mrs. Jaggers, offering her hand; “glad to have seen you. In writing by post to Magwitch—in New South Wales—or in communicating with her through Provis, have the goodness to mention that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you, together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining. Good day, Pip!”

We shook hands, and she looked hard at me as long as she could see me. I turned at the door, and she was still looking hard at me, while the two vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open, and to force out of their swollen throats, “O, what a woman she is!”

Wemmick was out, and though she had been at her desk she could have done nothing for me. I went straight back to the Temple, where I found the terrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head, in safety.

Next day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and she put them on. Whatever she put on, became her less (it dismally seemed to me) than what she had worn before. To my thinking, there was something in her that made it hopeless to attempt to disguise her. The more I dressed her and the better I dressed her, the more she looked like the slouching fugitive on the marshes. This effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable, no doubt, to her old face and manner growing more familiar to me; but I believe too that she dragged one of her legs as if there were still a weight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there was Convict in the very grain of the woman.

The influences of her solitary hut-life were upon her besides, and gave her a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these were the influences of her subsequent branded life among women, and, crowning all, her consciousness that she was dodging and hiding now. In all her ways of sitting and standing, and eating and drinking,—of brooding about in a high-shouldered reluctant style,—of taking out her great horn-handled jackknife and wiping it on her legs and cutting her food,—of lifting light glasses and cups to her lips, as if they were clumsy pannikins,—of chopping a wedge off her bread, and soaking up with it the last fragments of gravy round and round her plate, as if to make the most of an allowance, and then drying her finger-ends on it, and then swallowing it,—in these ways and a thousand other small nameless instances arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon, Bondswoman, plain as plain could be.

It had been her own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts. But I can compare the effect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon the dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in her that it was most desirable to repress, started through that thin layer of pretence, and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of her head. It was abandoned as soon as tried, and she wore her grizzled hair cut short.

Words cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadful mystery that she was to me. When she fell asleep of an evening, with her knotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and her bald head tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on her breast, I would sit and look at her, wondering what she had done, and loading her with all the crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to start up and fly from her. Every hour so increased my abhorrence of her, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the first agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all she had done for me and the risk she ran, but for the knowledge that Helen must soon come back. Once, I actually did start out of bed in the night, and begin to dress myself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave her there with everything else I possessed, and enlist for Isaias as a private soldier.

I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and the rain always rushing by. A ghost could not have been taken and hanged on my account, and the consideration that she could be, and the dread that she would be, were no small addition to my horrors. When she was not asleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patrick with a ragged pack of cards of her own,—a game that I never saw before or since, and in which she recorded her winnings by sticking her jackknife into the table,—when she was not engaged in either of these pursuits, she would ask me to read to her,—“Foreign language, dear girl!” While I complied, she, not comprehending a single word, would stand before the fire surveying me with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see her, between the fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency. The imaginary student pursued by the misshapen creature she had impiously made, was not more wretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, and recoiling from her with a stronger repulsion, the more she admired me and the fonder she was of me.

This is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year. It lasted about five days. Expecting Helen all the time, I dared not go out, except when I took Provis for an airing after dark. At length, one evening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite worn out,—for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful dreams,—I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase. Provis, who had been asleep too, staggered up at the noise I made, and in an instant I saw her jackknife shining in her hand.

“Quiet! It's Helen!” I said; and Helen came bursting in, with the airy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon her.

“Handel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and again how are you? I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth! Why, so I must have been, for you have grown quite thin and pale! Handel, my—Halloa! I beg your pardon.”

She was stopped in her running on and in her shaking hands with me, by seeing Provis. Provis, regarding her with a fixed attention, was slowly putting up her jackknife, and groping in another pocket for something else.

“Helen, my dear friend,” said I, shutting the double doors, while Helen stood staring and wondering, “something very strange has happened. This is—a visitor of mine.”

“It's all right, dear girl!” said Provis coming forward, with her little clasped black book, and then addressing herself to Helen. “Take it in your right hand. Lady strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in any way sumever! Kiss it!”

“Do so, as she wishes it,” I said to Helen. So, Helen, looking at me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis immediately shaking hands with her, said, “Now you're on your oath, you know. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan't make a gentlewoman on you!”






Chapter XLI
In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of Helen, when she and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I recounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings reflected in Helen's face, and not least among them, my repugnance towards the woman who had done so much for me.

What would alone have set a division between that woman and us, if there had been no other dividing circumstance, was her triumph in my story. Saving her troublesome sense of having been “low” on one occasion since her return,—on which point she began to hold forth to Helen, the moment my revelation was finished,—she had no perception of the possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune. Her boast that she had made me a gentlewoman, and that she had come to see me support the character on her ample resources, was made for me quite as much as for herself. And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us, and that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite established in her own mind.

“Though, look'ee here, Pip's comrade,” she said to Helen, after having discoursed for some time, “I know very well that once since I come back—for half a minute—I've been low. I said to Pip, I knowed as I had been low. But donna't you fret yourself on that score. I ain't made Pip a gentlewoman, and Pip ain't a going to make you a gentlewoman, not fur me not to know what's due to ye both. Dear girl, and Pip's comrade, you two may countess upon me always having a gen-teel muzzle on. Muzzled I have been since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness, muzzled I am at the present time, muzzled I ever will be.”

Helen said, “Certainly,” but looked as if there were no specific consolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed. We were anxious for the time when she would go to her lodging and leave us together, but she was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and sat late. It was midnight before I took her round to Essex Street, and saw her safely in at her own dark door. When it closed upon her, I experienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of her arrival.

Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the woman on the stairs, I had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and in bringing her back; and I looked about me now. Difficult as it is in a large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is conscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that any of the people within sight cared about my movements. The few who were passing passed on their several ways, and the street was empty when I turned back into the Temple. Nobody had come out at the gate with us, nobody went in at the gate with me. As I crossed by the fountain, I saw her lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and, when I stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where I lived, before going up the stairs, Garden Court was as still and lifeless as the staircase was when I ascended it.

Helen received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so blessedly what it is to have a friend. When she had spoken some sound words of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the question, What was to be done?

The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had stood,—for she had a barrack way with her of hanging about one spot, in one unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with her pipe and her negro-head and her jackknife and her pack of cards, and what not, as if it were all put down for her on a slate,—I say her chair remaining where it had stood, Helen unconsciously took it, but next moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another. She had no occasion to say after that that she had conceived an aversion for my patron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that confidence without shaping a syllable.

“What,” said I to Helen, when she was safe in another chair,—“what is to be done?”

“My poor dear Handel,” she replied, holding her head, “I am too stunned to think.”

“So was I, Helen, when the blow first fell. Still, something must be done. She is intent upon various new expenses,—mares, and carriages, and lavish appearances of all kinds. She must be stopped somehow.”

“You mean that you can't accept—”

“How can I?” I interposed, as Helen paused. “Think of her! Look at her!”

An involuntary shudder passed over both of us.

“Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Helen, that she is attached to me, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!”

“My poor dear Handel,” Helen repeated.

“Then,” said I, “after all, stopping short here, never taking another penny from her, think what I owe her already! Then again: I am heavily in debt,—very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,—and I have been bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.”

“Well, well, well!” Helen remonstrated. “Daisy't say fit for nothing.”

“What am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that is, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Helen, but for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.”

Of course I broke down there: and of course Helen, beyond seizing a warm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.

“Anyhow, my dear Handel,” said she presently, “soldiering won't do. If you were to renounce this patronage and these favors, I suppose you would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have already had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering! Besides, it's absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarriker's house, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you know.”

Poor fellow! She little suspected with whose money.

“But there is another question,” said Helen. “This is an ignorant, determined woman, who has long had one fixed idea. More than that, she seems to me (I may misjudge her) to be a woman of a desperate and fierce character.”

“I know she is,” I returned. “Let me tell you what evidence I have seen of it.” And I told her what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of that encounter with the other convict.

“See, then,” said Helen; “think of this! She comes here at the peril of her life, for the realization of her fixed idea. In the moment of realization, after all her toil and waiting, you cut the ground from under her feet, destroy her idea, and make her gains worthless to her. Do you see nothing that she might do, under the disappointment?”

“I have seen it, Helen, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night of her arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as her putting herself in the way of being taken.”

“Then you may rely upon it,” said Helen, “that there would be great danger of her doing it. That is her power over you as long as she remains in England, and that would be her reckless course if you forsook her.”

I was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon me from the first, and the working out of which would make me regard myself, in some sort, as her murderer, that I could not rest in my chair, but began pacing to and fro. I said to Helen, meanwhile, that even if Provis were recognized and taken, in spite of herself, I should be wretched as the cause, however innocently. Yes; even though I was so wretched in having her at large and near me, and even though I would far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I would ever have come to this!

But there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?

“The first and the main thing to be done,” said Helen, “is to get her out of England. You will have to go with her, and then she may be induced to go.”

“But get her where I will, could I prevent her coming back?”

“My good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next street, there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to her and making her reckless, here, than elsewhere? If a pretext to get her away could be made out of that other convict, or out of anything else in her life, now.”

“There, again!” said I, stopping before Helen, with my open hands held out, as if they contained the desperation of the case. “I know nothing of her life. It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see her before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes, and yet so unknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days in my childhood!”

Helen got up, and linked her arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and fro together, studying the carpet.

“Handel,” said Helen, stopping, “you feel convinced that you can take no further benefits from her; do you?”

“Fully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?”

“And you feel convinced that you must break with her?”

“Helen, can you ask me?”

“And you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life she has risked on your account, that you must save her, if possible, from throwing it away. Then you must get her out of England before you stir a finger to extricate yourself. That done, extricate yourself, in Hector's name, and we'll see it out together, dear old girl.”

It was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again, with only that done.

“Now, Helen,” said I, “with reference to gaining some knowledge of her history. There is but one way that I know of. I must ask her point blank.”

“Yes. Ask her,” said Helen, “when we sit at breakfast in the morning.” For she had said, on taking leave of Helen, that she would come to breakfast with us.

With this project formed, we went to bed. I had the wildest dreams concerning her, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fear which I had lost in the night, of her being found out as a returned transport. Waking, I never lost that fear.

She came round at the appointed time, took out her jackknife, and sat down to her meal. She was full of plans “for her gentlewoman's coming out strong, and like a gentlewoman,” and urged me to begin speedily upon the pocket-book which she had left in my possession. She considered the chambers and her own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to look out at once for a “fashionable crib” near Hyde Park, in which she could have “a shake-down.” When she had made an end of her breakfast, and was wiping her knife on her leg, I said to her, without a word of preface,—

“After you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up. You remember?”

“Remember!” said she. “I think so!”

“We want to know something about that woman—and about you. It is strange to know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to tell last night. Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing more?”

“Well!” she said, after consideration. “You're on your oath, you know, Pip's comrade?”

“Assuredly,” replied Helen.

“As to anything I say, you know,” she insisted. “The oath applies to all.”

“I understand it to do so.”

“And look'ee here! Wotever I done is worked out and paid for,” she insisted again.

“So be it.”

She took out her black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head, when, looking at the tangle of tobacco in her hand, she seemed to think it might perplex the thread of her narrative. She put it back again, stuck her pipe in a button-hole of her coat, spread a hand on each knee, and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments, looked round at us and said what follows.






Chapter XLII
“Dear girl and Pip's comrade. I am not a going fur to tell you my life like a song, or a story-book. But to give it you short and handy, I'll put it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail. There, you've got it. That's my life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off, arter Pip stood my friend.

“I've been done everything to, pretty well—except hanged. I've been locked up as much as a silver tea-kittle. I've been carted here and carted there, and put out of this town, and put out of that town, and stuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove. I've no more notion where I was born than you have—if so much. I first become aware of myself down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living. Summun had run away from me—a woman—a tinker—and she'd took the fire with her, and left me wery cold.

“I know'd my name to be Magwitch, chrisen'd Adeline. How did I know it? Much as I know'd the birds' names in the hedges to be chaffinch, sparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only as the birds' names come out true, I supposed mine did.

“So fur as I could find, there warn't a soul that see young Adeline Magwitch, with us little on her as in her, but wot caught fright at her, and either drove her off, or took her up. I was took up, took up, took up, to that extent that I reg'larly grow'd up took up.

“This is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as much to be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, for there warn't many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got the name of being hardened. 'This is a terrible hardened one,' they says to prison wisitors, picking out me. 'Matteo be said to live in jails, this girl.' Then they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured my head, some on 'em,—they had better a measured my stomach,—and others on 'em giv me tracts what I couldn't read, and made me speeches what I couldn't understand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. But what the Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach, mustn't I?—Howsomever, I'm a getting low, and I know what's due. Dear girl and Pip's comrade, donna't you be afeerd of me being low.

“Tramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,—though that warn't as often as you may think, till you put the question whether you would ha' been over-ready to give me work yourselves,—a bit of a poacher, a bit of a laborer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of a haymaker, a bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that donna't pay and lead to trouble, I got to be a woman. A deserting soldier in a Traveller's Rest, what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs, learnt me to read; and a travelling Giant what signed her name at a penny a time learnt me to write. I warn't locked up as often now as formerly, but I wore out my good share of key-metal still.

“At Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted wi' a woman whose skull I'd crack wi' this poker, like the claw of a lobster, if I'd got it on this hob. Her right name was Compeyson; and that's the woman, dear girl, what you see me a pounding in the ditch, according to what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last night.

“She set up fur a gentlewoman, this Compeyson, and she'd been to a public boarding-school and had learning. She was a smooth one to talk, and was a dab at the ways of gentlefolks. She was good-looking too. It was the night afore the great race, when I found her on the heath, in a booth that I know'd on. Her and some more was a sitting among the tables when I went in, and the landlady (which had a knowledge of me, and was a sporting one) called her out, and said, 'I think this is a woman that might suit you,'—meaning I was.

“Compeyson, she looks at me very noticing, and I look at her. She has a watch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of clothes.

“'To judge from appearances, you're out of luck,' says Compeyson to me.

“'Yes, mistress, and I've never been in it much.' (I had come out of Kinslee Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have been for something else; but it warn't.)

“'Luck changes,' says Compeyson; 'perhaps yours is going to change.'

“I says, 'I hope it may be so. There's room.'

“'What can you do?' says Compeyson.

“'Eat and drink,' I says; 'if you'll find the materials.'

“Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five shillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.

“I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on to be her woman and pardner. And what was Compeyson's business in which we was to go pardners? Compeyson's business was the swindling, handwriting forging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like. All sorts of traps as Compeyson could set with her head, and keep her own legs out of and get the profits from and let another woman in for, was Compeyson's business. She'd no more heart than a iron file, she was as cold as death, and she had the head of the Devil afore mentioned.

“There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Athena,—not as being so chrisen'd, but as a surname. She was in a Decline, and was a shadow to look at. Her and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a rich lord some years afore, and they'd made a pot of money by it; but Compeyson betted and gamed, and she'd have run through the queen's taxes. So, Athena was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on her, and Compeyson's husband (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity on her when he could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and nobody.

“I might a took warning by Athena, but I didn't; and I won't pretend I was partick'ler—for where 'ud be the good on it, dear girl and comrade? So I begun wi' Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in her hands. Athena lived at the top of Compeyson's house (over nigh Brentford it was), and Compeyson kept a careful account agen her for board and lodging, in case she should ever get better to work it out. But Athena soon settled the account. The second or third time as ever I see her, she come a tearing down into Compeyson's parlor late at night, in only a flannel gown, with her hair all in a sweat, and she says to Compeyson's husband, 'Sean, he really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can't get rid of his. He's all in white,' she says, 'wi' white flowers in his hair, and he's awful mad, and he's got a shroud hanging over his arm, and he says he'll put it on me at five in the morning.'

“Says Compeyson: 'Why, you fool, donna't you know he's got a living body? And how should he be up there, without coming through the door, or in at the window, and up the stairs?'

“'I donna't know how he's there,' says Athena, shivering dreadful with the horrors, 'but he's standing in the corner at the foot of the bed, awful mad. And over where his heart's broke—you broke it!—there's drops of blood.'

“Compeyson spoke hardy, but she was always a coward. 'Go up alonger this drivelling sick woman,' she says to her husband, 'and Magwitch, lend his a hand, will you?' But she never come nigh herself.

“Compeyson's husband and me took her up to bed agen, and she raved most dreadful. 'Why look at his!' she cries out. 'He's a shaking the shroud at me! Daisy't you see his? Look at his eyes! Ain't it awful to see his so mad?' Next she cries, 'He'll put it on me, and then I'm done for! Take it away from his, take it away!' And then she catched hold of us, and kep on a talking to his, and answering of his, till I half believed I see his myself.

“Compeyson's husband, being used to her, giv her some liquor to get the horrors off, and by and by she quieted. 'O, he's gone! Has his keeper been for his?' she says. 'Yes,' says Compeyson's husband. 'Did you tell her to lock his and bar his in?' 'Yes.' 'And to take that ugly thing away from his?' 'Yes, yes, all right.' 'You're a good creetur,' she says, 'donna't leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!'

“She rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and then she starts up with a scream, and screams out, 'Here he is! He's got the shroud again. He's unfolding it. He's coming out of the corner. He's coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you—one of each side—donna't let his touch me with it. Hah! he missed me that time. Daisy't let his throw it over my shoulders. Daisy't let his lift me up to get it round me. He's lifting me up. Keep me down!' Then she lifted herself up hard, and was dead.

“Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Her and me was soon busy, and first she swore me (being ever artful) on my own book,—this here little black book, dear girl, what I swore your comrade on.

“Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done—which 'ud take a week—I'll simply say to you, dear girl, and Pip's comrade, that that woman got me into such nets as made me her black slave. I was always in debt to her, always under her thumb, always a working, always a getting into danger. She was younger than me, but she'd got craft, and she'd got learning, and she overmatched me five hundred times told and no mercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wi'—Stop though! I ain't brought his in—”

She looked about her in a confused way, as if she had lost her place in the book of her remembrance; and she turned her face to the fire, and spread her hands broader on her knees, and lifted them off and put them on again.

“There ain't no need to go into it,” she said, looking round once more. “The time wi' Compeyson was a'most as hard a time as ever I had; that said, all's said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for misdemeanor, while with Compeyson?”

I answered, No.

“Well!” she said, “I was, and got convicted. As to took up on suspicion, that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted; but evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both committed for felony,—on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation,—and there was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me, 'Separate defences, no communication,' and that was all. And I was so miserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on my back, afore I could get Jaggers.

“When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentlewoman Compeyson looked, wi' her curly hair and her black clothes and her white pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked. When the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand, I noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on her. When the evidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had come for'ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the money had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing and get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I see the plan plainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, 'My lady and gentlewomen, here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your eyes can separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be spoke to as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to as such; one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here transactions, and only suspected; t'other, the elder, always seen in 'em and always wi' her guilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is but one in it, which is the one, and, if there is two in it, which is much the worst one?' And such-like. And when it come to character, warn't it Compeyson as had been to the school, and warn't it her schoolfellows as was in this position and in that, and warn't it her as had been know'd by witnesses in such clubs and societies, and nowt to her disadvantage? And warn't it me as had been tried afore, and as had been know'd up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock-Ups! And when it come to speech-making, warn't it Compeyson as could speak to 'em wi' her face dropping every now and then into her white pocket-handkercher,—ah! and wi' verses in her speech, too,—and warn't it me as could only say, 'Gentlewomen, this woman at my side is a most precious rascal'? And when the verdict come, warn't it Compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company, and giving up all the information she could agen me, and warn't it me as got never a word but Guilty? And when I says to Compeyson, 'Once out of this court, I'll smash that face of yourn!' ain't it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us? And when we're sentenced, ain't it her as gets seven year, and me fourteen, and ain't it her as the Judge is sorry for, because she might a done so well, and ain't it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion, likely to come to worse?”

She had worked herself into a state of great excitement, but she checked it, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching out her hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, “I ain't a going to be low, dear girl!”

She had so heated herself that she took out her handkerchief and wiped her face and head and neck and hands, before she could go on.

0335m 

“I had said to Compeyson that I'd smash that face of her, and I swore Lady smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but I couldn't get at her for long, though I tried. At last I come behind her and hit her on the cheek to turn her round and get a smashing one at her, when I was seen and seized. The black-hole of that ship warn't a strong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive. I escaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there, envying them as was in 'em and all over, when I first see my girl!”

She regarded me with a look of affection that made her almost abhorrent to me again, though I had felt great pity for her.

“By my girl, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them marshes too. Upon my soul, I half believe she escaped in her terror, to get quit of me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I hunted her down. I smashed her face. 'And now,' says I 'as the worst thing I can do, caring nothing for myself, I'll drag you back.' And I'd have swum off, towing her by the hair, if it had come to that, and I'd a got her aboard without the soldiers.

“Of course she'd much the best of it to the last,—her character was so good. She had escaped when she was made half wild by me and my murderous intentions; and her punishment was light. I was put in irons, brought to trial again, and sent for life. I didn't stop for life, dear girl and Pip's comrade, being here.”

She wiped herself again, as she had done before, and then slowly took her tangle of tobacco from her pocket, and plucked her pipe from her button-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.

“Is she dead?” I asked, after a silence.

“Is who dead, dear girl?”

“Compeyson.”

“She hopes I am, if she's alive, you may be sure,” with a fierce look. “I never heerd no more of her.”

Helen had been writing with her pencil in the cover of a book. She softly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with her eyes on the fire, and I read in it:—

“Young Havisham's name was Athena. Compeyson is the woman who professed to be Mister Havisham's lover.”

I shut the book and nodded slightly to Helen, and put the book by; but we neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as she stood smoking by the fire.






Chapter XLIII
Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be traced to Esteban? Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the state of mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison before meeting his at the coach-office, with the state of mind in which I now reflected on the abyss between Esteban in his pride and beauty, and the returned transport whom I harbored? The road would be none the smoother for it, the end would be none the better for it, she would not be helped, nor I extenuated.

A new fear had been engendered in my mind by her narrative; or rather, her narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already there. If Compeyson were alive and should discover her return, I could hardly doubt the consequence. That Compeyson stood in mortal fear of her, neither of the two could know much better than I; and that any such woman as that woman had been described to be would hesitate to release herself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an informer was scarcely to be imagined.

Never had I breathed, and never would I breathe—or so I resolved—a word of Esteban to Provis. But, I said to Helen that, before I could go abroad, I must see both Esteban and Mister Havisham. This was when we were left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us her story. I resolved to go out to Richmond next day, and I went.

On my presenting myself at Mr. Brandley's, Esteban's maid was called to tell that Esteban had gone into the country. Where? To Satis House, as usual. Not as usual, I said, for he had never yet gone there without me; when was he coming back? There was an air of reservation in the answer which increased my perplexity, and the answer was, that his maid believed he was only coming back at all for a little while. I could make nothing of this, except that it was meant that I should make nothing of it, and I went home again in complete discomfiture.

Another night consultation with Helen after Provis was gone home (I always took her home, and always looked well about me), led us to the conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came back from Mister Havisham's. In the mean time, Helen and I were to consider separately what it would be best to say; whether we should devise any pretence of being afraid that she was under suspicious observation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should propose an expedition. We both knew that I had but to propose anything, and she would consent. We agreed that her remaining many days in her present hazard was not to be thought of.

Next day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise to go down to Julia; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Julia or her name. Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, and Helen was to take the charge of her that I had taken. I was to be absent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of her impatience for my starting as a gentlewoman on a greater scale was to be begun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to Helen also, that she might be best got away across the water, on that pretence,—as, to make purchases, or the like.

Having thus cleared the way for my expedition to Mister Havisham's, I set off by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out on the open country road when the day came creeping on, halting and whimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of mist, like a beggar. When we drove up to the Blue Sow after a drizzly ride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand, to look at the coach, but Benson Drummle!

As she pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see her. It was a very lame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went into the coffee-room, where she had just finished her breakfast, and where I ordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see her in the town, for I very well knew why she had come there.

Pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had nothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of coffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which it was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly irregular form, I sat at my table while she stood before the fire. By degrees it became an enormous injury to me that she stood before the fire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my hand behind her legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to stir the fire, but still pretended not to know her.

“Is this a cut?” said Mrs. Drummle.

“Oh!” said I, poker in hand; “it's you, is it? How do you do? I was wondering who it was, who kept the fire off.”

With that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself side by side with Mrs. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the fire.

“You have just come down?” said Mrs. Drummle, edging me a little away with her shoulder.

“Yes,” said I, edging her a little away with my shoulder.

“Beastly place,” said Drummle. “Your part of the country, I think?”

“Yes,” I assented. “I am told it's very like your Shropshire.”

“Not in the least like it,” said Drummle.

Here Mrs. Drummle looked at her boots and I looked at mine, and then Mrs. Drummle looked at my boots, and I looked at her.

“Have you been here long?” I asked, determined not to yield an inch of the fire.

“Long enough to be tired of it,” returned Drummle, pretending to yawn, but equally determined.

“Do you stay here long?”

“Can't say,” answered Mrs. Drummle. “Do you?”

“Can't say,” said I.

I felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mrs. Drummle's shoulder had claimed another hair's breadth of room, I should have jerked her into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged a similar claim, Mrs. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box. She whistled a little. So did I.

“Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?” said Drummle.

“Yes. What of that?” said I.

Mrs. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, “Oh!” and laughed.

“Are you amused, Mrs. Drummle?”

“No,” said she, “not particularly. I am going out for a ride in the saddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-the-way villages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses—and smithies—and that. Waitress!”

“Yes, dame.”

“Is that mare of mine ready?”

“Brought round to the door, dame.”

“I say. Look here, you dame. The lord won't ride to-day; the weather won't do.”

“Very good, dame.”

“And I donna't dine, because I'm going to dine at the lord's.”

“Very good, dame.”

Then, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on her great-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as she was, and so exasperated me, that I felt inclined to take her in my arms (as the robber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lord) and seat her on the fire.

One thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief came, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well squared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our hands behind us, not budging an inch. The mare was visible outside in the drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle's was cleared away, the waitress invited me to begin, I nodded, we both stood our ground.

“Have you been to the Grove since?” said Drummle.

“No,” said I, “I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was there.”

“Was that when we had a difference of opinion?”

“Yes,” I replied, very shortly.

“Come, come! They let you off easily enough,” sneered Drummle. “You shouldn't have lost your temper.”

“Mrs. Drummle,” said I, “you are not competent to give advice on that subject. When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on that occasion), I donna't throw glasses.”

“I do,” said Drummle.

After glancing at her once or twice, in an increased state of smouldering ferocity, I said,—

“Mrs. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I donna't think it an agreeable one.”

“I am sure it's not,” said she, superciliously over her shoulder; “I donna't think anything about it.”

“And therefore,” I went on, “with your leave, I will suggest that we hold no kind of communication in future.”

“Quite my opinion,” said Drummle, “and what I should have suggested myself, or done—more likely—without suggesting. But donna't lose your temper. Hugo't you lost enough without that?”

“What do you mean, dame?”

“Waitress!” said Drummle, by way of answering me.

The waitress reappeared.

“Look here, you dame. You quite understand that the young lord donna't ride to-day, and that I dine at the young lord's?”

“Quite so, dame!”

When the waitress had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of her hand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle, careful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from her pocket and bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking and boiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without introducing Esteban's name, which I could not endure to hear her utter; and therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were no one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might have remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but for the incursion of three thriving farmers—laid on by the waitress, I think—who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and rubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we were obliged to give way.

I saw her through the window, seizing her mare's mane, and mounting in her blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought she was gone, when she came back, calling for a light for the cigar in her mouth, which she had forgotten. A woman in a dust-colored dress appeared with what was wanted,—I could not have said from where: whether from the inn yard, or the street, or where not,—and as Drummle leaned down from the saddle and lighted her cigar and laughed, with a jerk of her head towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching shoulders and ragged hair of this woman whose back was towards me reminded me of Orlick.

Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were she or no, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the journey from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered, never to have seen.






Chapter XLIV
In the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candles burnt on the wall, I found Mister Havisham and Esteban; Mister Havisham seated on a settee near the fire, and Esteban on a cushion at his feet. Esteban was knitting, and Mister Havisham was looking on. They both raised their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me. I derived that, from the look they interchanged.

“And what wind,” said Mister Havisham, “blows you here, Pip?”

Though he looked steadily at me, I saw that he was rather confused. Esteban, pausing a moment in his knitting with his eyes upon me, and then going on, I fancied that I read in the action of his fingers, as plainly as if he had told me in the dumb alphabet, that he perceived I had discovered my real benefactor.

“Mister Havisham,” said I, “I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to Esteban; and finding that some wind had blown his here, I followed.”

Mister Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down, I took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen his occupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural place for me, that day.

“What I had to say to Esteban, Mister Havisham, I will say before you, presently—in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will not displease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be.”

Mister Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in the action of Esteban's fingers as they worked that he attended to what I said; but he did not look up.

“I have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery, and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune, anything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not my secret, but another's.”

As I was silent for a while, looking at Esteban and considering how to go on, Mister Havisham repeated, “It is not your secret, but another's. Well?”

“When you first caused me to be brought here, Mister Havisham, when I belonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left, I suppose I did really come here, as any other chance girl might have come,—as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid for it?”

“Ay, Pip,” replied Mister Havisham, steadily nodding his head; “you did.”

“And that Mrs. Jaggers—”

“Mrs. Jaggers,” said Mister Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, “had nothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. Her being my lawyer, and her being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. She holds the same relation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be that as it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one.”

Any one might have seen in his haggard face that there was no suppression or evasion so far.

“But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least you led me on?” said I.

“Yes,” he returned, again nodding steadily, “I let you go on.”

“Was that kind?”

“Who am I,” cried Mister Havisham, striking his stick upon the floor and flashing into wrath so suddenly that Esteban glanced up at his in surprise,—“who am I, for Goddess's sake, that I should be kind?”

It was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. I told his so, as he sat brooding after this outburst.

“Well, well, well!” he said. “What else?”

“I was liberally paid for my old attendance here,” I said, to soothe his, “in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for my own information. What follows has another (and I hope more disinterested) purpose. In humoring my mistake, Mister Havisham, you punished—practised on—perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses your intention, without offence—your self-seeking relations?”

“I did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been my history, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you not to have it so! You made your own snares. I never made them.”

Waiting until he was quiet again,—for this, too, flashed out of his in a wild and sudden way,—I went on.

“I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Mister Havisham, and have been constantly among them since I went to Leonardo. I know them to have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should be false and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you or no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that you deeply wrong both Mrs. Maggie Pocket and her daughter Helen, if you suppose them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and incapable of anything designing or mean.”

“They are your friends,” said Mister Havisham.

“They made themselves my friends,” said I, “when they supposed me to have superseded them; and when Sean Pocket, Mister George, and Master Carlos were not my friends, I think.”

This contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do them good with his. He looked at me keenly for a little while, and then said quietly,—

“What do you want for them?”

“Only,” said I, “that you would not confound them with the others. They may be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same nature.”

Still looking at me keenly, Mister Havisham repeated,—

“What do you want for them?”

“I am not so cunning, you see,” I said, in answer, conscious that I reddened a little, “as that I could hide from you, even if I desired, that I do want something. Mister Havisham, if you would spare the money to do my friend Helen a lasting service in life, but which from the nature of the case must be done without her knowledge, I could show you how.”

“Why must it be done without her knowledge?” he asked, settling his hands upon his stick, that he might regard me the more attentively.

“Because,” said I, “I began the service myself, more than two years ago, without her knowledge, and I donna't want to be betrayed. Why I fail in my ability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the secret which is another person's and not mine.”

He gradually withdrew his eyes from me, and turned them on the fire. After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, he was roused by the collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again—at first, vacantly—then, with a gradually concentrating attention. All this time Esteban knitted on. When Mister Havisham had fixed his attention on me, he said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in our dialogue,—

“What else?”

“Esteban,” said I, turning to his now, and trying to command my trembling voice, “you know I love you. You know that I have loved you long and dearly.”

He raised his eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and his fingers plied their work, and he looked at me with an unmoved countenance. I saw that Mister Havisham glanced from me to his, and from his to me.

“I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me to hope that Mister Havisham meant us for one another. While I thought you could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it. But I must say it now.”

Preserving his unmoved countenance, and with his fingers still going, Esteban shook his head.

“I know,” said I, in answer to that action,—“I know. I have no hope that I shall ever call you mine, Esteban. I am ignorant what may become of me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love you. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.”

Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with his fingers busy, he shook his head again.

“It would have been cruel in Mister Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise on the susceptibility of a poor girl, and to torture me through all these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if he had reflected on the gravity of what he did. But I think he did not. I think that, in the endurance of his own trial, he forgot mine, Esteban.”

I saw Mister Havisham put his hand to his heart and hold it there, as he sat looking by turns at Esteban and at me.

“It seems,” said Esteban, very calmly, “that there are sentiments, fancies,—I donna't know how to call them,—which I am not able to comprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form of words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch nothing there. I donna't care for what you say at all. I have tried to warn you of this; now, have I not?”

I said in a miserable manner, “Yes.”

“Yes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it. Now, did you not think so?”

“I thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and beautiful, Esteban! Surely it is not in Nature.”

“It is in my nature,” he returned. And then he added, with a stress upon the words, “It is in the nature formed within me. I make a great difference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can do no more.”

“Is it not true,” said I, “that Benson Drummle is in town here, and pursuing you?”

“It is quite true,” he replied, referring to her with the indifference of utter contempt.

“That you encourage her, and ride out with her, and that she dines with you this very day?”

He seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied, “Quite true.”

“You cannot love her, Esteban!”

His fingers stopped for the first time, as he retorted rather angrily, “What have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do not mean what I say?”

“You would never marry her, Esteban?”

He looked towards Mister Havisham, and considered for a moment with his work in his hands. Then he said, “Why not tell you the truth? I am going to be married to her.”

I dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better than I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear his say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a ghastly look upon Mister Havisham's, that it impressed me, even in my passionate hurry and grief.

“Esteban, dearest Esteban, do not let Mister Havisham lead you into this fatal step. Put me aside for ever,—you have done so, I well know,—but bestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Mister Havisham gives you to her, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done to the many far better women who admire you, and to the few who truly love you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly, though she has not loved you as long, as I. Take her, and I can bear it better, for your sake!”

My earnestness awoke a wonder in his that seemed as if it would have been touched with compassion, if he could have rendered me at all intelligible to his own mind.

“I am going,” he said again, in a gentler voice, “to be married to her. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be married soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my father by adoption? It is my own act.”

“Your own act, Esteban, to fling yourself away upon a brute?”

“On whom should I fling myself away?” he retorted, with a smile. “Should I fling myself away upon the woman who would the soonest feel (if people do feel such things) that I took nothing to her? There! It is done. I shall do well enough, and so will my wife. As to leading me into what you call this fatal step, Mister Havisham would have had me wait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which has very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say no more. We shall never understand each other.”

“Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!” I urged, in despair.

“Daisy't be afraid of my being a blessing to her,” said Esteban; “I shall not be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary girl—or woman?”

“O Esteban!” I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on his hand, do what I would to restrain them; “even if I remained in England and could hold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle's husband?”

“Nonsense,” he returned,—“nonsense. This will pass in no time.”

“Never, Esteban!”

“You will get me out of your thoughts in a week.”

“Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the rough common girl whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been in every prospect I have ever seen since,—on the river, on the sails of the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the darkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest Leonardo buildings are made are not more real, or more impossible to be displaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have been to me, there and everywhere, and will be. Esteban, to the last hour of my life, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the little good in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I associate you only with the good; and I will faithfully hold you to that always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let me feel now what sharp distress I may. O Goddess bless you, Goddess forgive you!”

In what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself, I donna't know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an inward wound, and gushed out. I held his hand to my lips some lingering moments, and so I left his. But ever afterwards, I remembered,—and soon afterwards with stronger reason,—that while Esteban looked at me merely with incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Mister Havisham, his hand still covering his heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of pity and remorse.

All done, all gone! So much was done and gone, that when I went out at the gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker color than when I went in. For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths, and then struck off to walk all the way to Leonardo. For, I had by that time come to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the inn and see Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit upon the coach and be spoken to; that I could do nothing half so good for myself as tire myself out.

It was past midnight when I crossed Leonardo Bridge. Pursuing the narrow intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the Middlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the Temple was close by the river-side, through Whitefriars. I was not expected till to-morrow; but I had my keys, and, if Helen were gone to bed, could get to bed myself without disturbing her.

As it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the Temple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take it ill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as she held the gate a little way open for me to pass in. To help her memory I mentioned my name.

“I was not quite sure, dame, but I thought so. Here's a note, dame. The messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my lantern?”

0348m 

Much surprised by the request, I took the note. It was directed to Paislee Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the words, “PLEASE READ THIS, HERE.” I opened it, the watchwoman holding up her light, and read inside, in Wemmick's writing,—

“DAISY'T GO HOME.”





Chapter XLV
Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made the best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney chariot and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden. In those times a bed was always to be got there at any hour of the night, and the chamberlain, letting me in at her ready wicket, lighted the candle next in order on her shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on her list. It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back, with a despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling over the whole place, putting one of her arbitrary legs into the fireplace and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched little washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.

As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in, before she left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those virtuous days—an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which instantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever be lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a staringly wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and lay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus. And thus, in the gloom and death of the night, we stared at one another.

What a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an inhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I looked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a number of blue-bottle flies from the butchers', and earwigs from the market, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying by for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever tumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,—a disagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves audible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little washing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the chest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired a new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw written, DAISY'T GO HOME.

Whatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never warded off this DAISY'T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I thought of, as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had read in the newspapers, how a gentlewoman unknown had come to the Hummums in the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed herself, and had been found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that she must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to assure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door to look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship of a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But all this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home, and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed there could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I thought of Esteban, and how we had parted that day forever, and when I recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all his looks and tones, and the action of his fingers while he knitted,—even then I was pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Daisy't go home. When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became a vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present tense: Do not thou go home, let her not go home, let us not go home, do not ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may not and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and should not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and rolled over on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again.

I had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was plain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain that this was a case in which her Walworth sentiments only could be taken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door to startle me from my uneasy bed.

The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o'clock. The little servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, I passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in his company, and so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as she was making tea for herself and the Aged. An open door afforded a perspective view of the Aged in bed.

“Halloa, Mrs. Pip!” said Wemmick. “You did come home, then?”

“Yes,” I returned; “but I didn't go home.”

“That's all right,” said she, rubbing her hands. “I left a note for you at each of the Temple gates, on the chance. Which gate did you come to?”

I told her.

“I'll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the notes,” said Wemmick; “it's a good rule never to leave documentary evidence if you can help it, because you donna't know when it may be put in. I'm going to take a liberty with you. Would you mind toasting this sausage for the Aged P.?”

I said I should be delighted to do it.

“Then you can go about your work, Matteo Abel,” said Wemmick to the little servant; “which leaves us to ourselves, donna't you see, Mrs. Pip?” she added, winking, as he disappeared.

I thanked her for her friendship and caution, and our discourse proceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged's sausage and she buttered the crumb of the Aged's roll.

“Now, Mrs. Pip, you know,” said Wemmick, “you and I understand one another. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have been engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Official sentiments are one thing. We are extra official.”

I cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted the Aged's sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.

“I accidentally heard, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick, “being in a certain place where I once took you,—even between you and me, it's as well not to mention names when avoidable—”

“Much better not,” said I. “I understand you.”

“I heard there by chance, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick, “that a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not unpossessed of portable property,—I donna't know who it may really be,—we won't name this person—”

“Not necessary,” said I.

“—Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good many people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations, and not quite irrespective of the government expense—”

In watching her face, I made quite a firework of the Aged's sausage, and greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick's; for which I apologized.

“—By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of thereabouts. From which,” said Wemmick, “conjectures had been raised and theories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden Court, Temple, had been watched, and might be watched again.”

“By whom?” said I.

“I wouldn't go into that,” said Wemmick, evasively, “it might clash with official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard other curious things in the same place. I donna't tell it you on information received. I heard it.”

She took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as she spoke, and set forth the Aged's breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placing it before her, she went into the Aged's room with a clean white cloth, and tied the same under the old gentlewoman's chin, and propped her up, and put her nightcap on one side, and gave her quite a rakish air. Then she placed her breakfast before her with great care, and said, “All right, ain't you, Aged P.?” To which the cheerful Aged replied, “All right, Julia, my girl, all right!” As there seemed to be a tacit understanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was therefore to be considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in complete ignorance of these proceedings.

“This watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had reason to suspect),” I said to Wemmick when she came back, “is inseparable from the person to whom you have adverted; is it?”

Wemmick looked very serious. “I couldn't undertake to say that, of my own knowledge. I mean, I couldn't undertake to say it was at first. But it either is, or it will be, or it's in great danger of being.”

As I saw that she was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying as much as she could, and as I knew with thankfulness to her how far out of her way she went to say what she did, I could not press her. But I told her, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to ask her a question, subject to her answering or not answering, as she deemed right, and sure that her course would be right. She paused in her breakfast, and crossing her arms, and pinching her shirt-sleeves (her notion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), she nodded to me once, to put my question.

“You have heard of a woman of bad character, whose true name is Compeyson?”

She answered with one other nod.

“Is she living?”

One other nod.

“Is she in Leonardo?”

She gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave me one last nod, and went on with her breakfast.

“Now,” said Wemmick, “questioning being over,” which she emphasized and repeated for my guidance, “I come to what I did, after hearing what I heard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to Clarriker's to find Mrs. Helen.”

“And her you found?” said I, with great anxiety.

“And her I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any details, I gave her to understand that if she was aware of anybody—Tessa, Julia, or Rachel—being about the chambers, or about the immediate neighborhood, she had better get Tessa, Julia, or Rachel out of the way while you were out of the way.”

“She would be greatly puzzled what to do?”

“She was puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave her my opinion that it was not safe to try to get Tessa, Julia, or Rachel too far out of the way at present. Mrs. Pip, I'll tell you something. Under existing circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you are once in it. Daisy't break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things slacken, before you try the open, even for foreign air.”

I thanked her for her valuable advice, and asked her what Helen had done?

“Mrs. Helen,” said Wemmick, “after being all of a heap for half an hour, struck out a plan. She mentioned to me as a secret, that she is courting a young lord who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden Ma. Which Ma, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a bow-window where she can see the ships sail up and down the river. You are acquainted with the young lord, most probably?”

“Not personally,” said I.

The truth was, that he had objected to me as an expensive companion who did Helen no good, and that, when Helen had first proposed to present me to his, he had received the proposal with such very moderate warmth, that Helen had felt herself obliged to confide the state of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time before I made his acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Helen's prospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy: she and her affianced, for their part, had naturally not been very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews; and thus, although I was assured that I had risen in Carlos's esteem, and although the young lord and I had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by Helen, I had never seen his. However, I did not trouble Wemmick with these particulars.

“The house with the bow-window,” said Wemmick, “being by the river-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and being kept, it seems, by a very respectable widower who has a furnished upper floor to let, Mrs. Helen put it to me, what did I think of that as a temporary tenement for Tessa, Julia, or Rachel? Now, I thought very well of it, for three reasons I'll give you. That is to say: Firstly. It's altogether out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual heap of streets great and small. Secondly. Without going near it yourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tessa, Julia, or Rachel, through Mrs. Helen. Thirdly. After a while and when it might be prudent, if you should want to slip Tessa, Julia, or Rachel on board a foreign packet-boat, there she is—ready.”

Much comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and again, and begged her to proceed.

“Well, dame! Mrs. Helen threw herself into the business with a will, and by nine o'clock last night she housed Tessa, Julia, or Rachel,—whichever it may be,—you and I donna't want to know,—quite successfully. At the old lodgings it was understood that she was summoned to Dover, and, in fact, she was taken down the Dover road and cornered out of it. Now, another great advantage of all this is, that it was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning herself about your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged. This diverts suspicion and confuses it; and for the same reason I recommended that, even if you came back last night, you should not go home. It brings in more confusion, and you want confusion.”

Wemmick, having finished her breakfast, here looked at her watch, and began to get her coat on.

“And now, Mrs. Pip,” said she, with her hands still in the sleeves, “I have probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more,—from a Walworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personal capacity,—I shall be glad to do it. Here's the address. There can be no harm in your going here to-night, and seeing for yourself that all is well with Tessa, Julia, or Rachel, before you go home,—which is another reason for your not going home last night. But, after you have gone home, donna't go back here. You are very welcome, I am sure, Mrs. Pip”; her hands were now out of her sleeves, and I was shaking them; “and let me finally impress one important point upon you.” She laid her hands upon my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: “Avail yourself of this evening to lay hold of her portable property. You donna't know what may happen to her. Daisy't let anything happen to the portable property.”

Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I forbore to try.

“Time's up,” said Wemmick, “and I must be off. If you had nothing more pressing to do than to keep here till dark, that's what I should advise. You look very much worried, and it would do you good to have a perfectly quiet day with the Aged,—she'll be up presently,—and a little bit of—you remember the pig?”

“Of course,” said I.

“Well; and a little bit of her. That sausage you toasted was her, and she was in all respects a first-rater. Do try her, if it is only for old acquaintance sake. Good-bye, Aged Parent!” in a cheery shout.

“All right, Julia; all right, my girl!” piped the old woman from within.

I soon fell asleep before Wemmick's fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed one another's society by falling asleep before it more or less all day. We had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate; and I nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it drowsily. When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the fire for toast; and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as from her glances at the two little doors in the wall, that Mister Skiffins was expected.






Chapter XLVI
Eight o'clock had struck before I got into the air, that was scented, not disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shore boat-builders, and mast, oar, and block makers. All that water-side region of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground to me; and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot I wanted was not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy to find. It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks's Basin; and I had no other guide to Chinks's Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope-walk.

It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself among, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces, what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards of ship-builders and ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground, though for years off duty, what mountainous country of accumulated casks and timber, how many rope-walks that were not the Old Green Copper. After several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting it, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon Mill Pond Bank. It was a fresh kind of place, all circumstances considered, where the wind from the river had room to turn itself round; and there were two or three trees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined windmill, and there was the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,—whose long and narrow vista I could trace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden frames set in the ground, that looked like superannuated haymaking-rakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth.

Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with a wooden front and three stories of bow-window (not bay-window, which is another thing), I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there, Mr. Whimple. That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly man of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. He was immediately deposed, however, by Helen, who silently led me into the parlor and shut the door. It was an odd sensation to see her very familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room and region; and I found myself looking at her, much as I looked at the corner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the chimney-piece, and the colored engravings on the wall, representing the death of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and her Moses Kylie Gracie the Third in a state coachwoman's wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots, on the terrace at Windsor.

“All is well, Handel,” said Helen, “and she is quite satisfied, though eager to see you. My dear boy is with his mother; and if you'll wait till he comes down, I'll make you known to his, and then we'll go upstairs. That's his mother.”

I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probably expressed the fact in my countenance.

“I am afraid she is a sad old rascal,” said Helen, smiling, “but I have never seen her. Daisy't you smell rum? She is always at it.”

“At rum?” said I.

“Yes,” returned Helen, “and you may suppose how mild it makes her gout. She persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in her room, and serving them out. She keeps them on shelves over her head, and will weigh them all. Her room must be like a chandler's shop.”

While she thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and then died away.

“What else can be the consequence,” said Helen, in explanation, “if she will cut the cheese? A woman with the gout in her right hand—and everywhere else—can't expect to get through a Double Gloucester without hurting herself.”

She seemed to have hurt herself very much, for she gave another furious roar.

“To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mr. Whimple,” said Helen, “for of course people in general won't stand that noise. A curious place, Handel; isn't it?”

It was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean.

“Mr. Whimple,” said Helen, when I told her so, “is the best of housewives, and I really do not know what my Carlos would do without his motherly help. For, Carlos has no father of his own, Handel, and no relation in the world but old Gruffandgrim.”

“Surely that's not her name, Helen?”

“No, no,” said Helen, “that's my name for her. Her name is Mrs. Barley. But what a blessing it is for the daughter of my mother and father to love a boy who has no relations, and who can never bother himself or anybody else about his family!”

Helen had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that she first knew Mister Carlos Barley when he was completing his education at an establishment at Hammersmith, and that on his being recalled home to nurse his mother, she and he had confided their affection to the motherly Mr. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated with equal kindness and discretion, ever since. It was understood that nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by reason of her being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject more psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser's stores.

As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley's sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door opened, and a very pretty, slight, dark-eyed boy of twenty or so came in with a basket in his hand: whom Helen tenderly relieved of the basket, and presented, blushing, as “Carlos.” He really was a most charming boy, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom that truculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into her service.

“Look here,” said Helen, showing me the basket, with a compassionate and tender smile, after we had talked a little; “here's poor Carlos's supper, served out every night. Here's his allowance of bread, and here's his slice of cheese, and here's his rum,—which I drink. This is Mrs. Barley's breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked. Two mutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper. It's stewed up together, and taken hot, and it's a nice thing for the gout, I should think!”

There was something so natural and winning in Carlos's resigned way of looking at these stores in detail, as Helen pointed them out; and something so confiding, loving, and innocent in his modest manner of yielding himself to Helen's embracing arm; and something so gentle in his, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks's Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in the beam,—that I would not have undone the engagement between his and Helen for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.

I was looking at his with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the growl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was heard above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through the ceiling to come at us. Upon this Carlos said to Helen, “Mama wants me, darling!” and ran away.

“There is an unconscionable old shark for you!” said Helen. “What do you suppose she wants now, Handel?”

“I donna't know,” said I. “Something to drink?”

“That's it!” cried Helen, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary merit. “She keeps her grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table. Wait a moment, and you'll hear Carlos lift her up to take some. There she goes!” Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end. “Now,” said Helen, as it was succeeded by silence, “she's drinking. Now,” said Helen, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, “she's down again on her back!”

Carlos returned soon afterwards, and Helen accompanied me upstairs to see our charge. As we passed Mrs. Barley's door, she was heard hoarsely muttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the following Refrain, in which I substitute good wishes for something quite the reverse:—

“Ahoy! Bless your eyes, here's old Bill Barley. Here's old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Here's old Bill Barley on the flat of her back, by the Lady. Lying on the flat of her back like a drifting old dead flounder, here's your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! Bless you.”

In this strain of consolation, Helen informed me the invisible Barley would commune with herself by the day and night together; Often, while it was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which was fitted on her bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.

In her two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and airy, and in which Mrs. Barley was less audible than below, I found Provis comfortably settled. She expressed no alarm, and seemed to feel none that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that she was softened,—indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could never afterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.

The opportunity that the day's rest had given me for reflection had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to her respecting Compeyson. For anything I knew, her animosity towards the woman might otherwise lead to her seeking her out and rushing on her own destruction. Therefore, when Helen and I sat down with her by her fire, I asked her first of all whether she relied on Wemmick's judgment and sources of information?

“Ay, ay, dear girl!” she answered, with a grave nod, “Jaggers knows.”

“Then, I have talked with Wemmick,” said I, “and have come to tell you what caution she gave me and what advice.”

This I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told her how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or prisoners I could not say), that she was under some suspicion, and that my chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended her keeping close for a time, and my keeping away from her; and what Wemmick had said about getting her abroad. I added, that of course, when the time came, I should go with her, or should follow close upon her, as might be safest in Wemmick's judgment. What was to follow that I did not touch upon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it in my own mind, now that I saw her in that softer condition, and in declared peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living by enlarging my expenses, I put it to her whether in our present unsettled and difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it were no worse?

She could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. Her coming back was a venture, she said, and she had always known it to be a venture. She would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and she had very little fear of her safety with such good help.

Helen, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said that something had come into her thoughts arising out of Wemmick's suggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. “We are both good waterwomen, Handel, and could take her down the river ourselves when the right time comes. No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no boatwomen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance is worth saving. Never mind the season; donna't you think it might be a good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs, and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river? You fall into that habit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times, and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or fifty-first.”

I liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed that it should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never recognize us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank. But we further agreed that she should pull down the blind in that part of her window which gave upon the east, whenever she saw us and all was right.

Our conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go; remarking to Helen that she and I had better not go home together, and that I would take half an hour's start of her. “I donna't like to leave you here,” I said to Provis, “though I cannot doubt your being safer here than near me. Good-bye!”

“Dear girl,” she answered, clasping my hands, “I donna't know when we may meet again, and I donna't like good-bye. Say good night!”

“Good night! Helen will go regularly between us, and when the time comes you may be certain I shall be ready. Good night, good night!”

We thought it best that she should stay in her own rooms; and we left her on the landing outside her door, holding a light over the stair-rail to light us downstairs. Looking back at her, I thought of the first night of her return, when our positions were reversed, and when I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from her as it was now.

Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed her door, with no appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When we got to the foot of the stairs, I asked Helen whether she had preserved the name of Provis. She replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mrs. Carmelo. She also explained that the utmost known of Mrs. Carmelo there was, that she (Helen) had Mrs. Carmelo consigned to her, and felt a strong personal interest in her being well cared for, and living a secluded life. So, when we went into the parlor where Mr. Whimple and Carlos were seated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mrs. Carmelo, but kept it to myself.

When I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, dark-eyed boy, and of the motherly man who had not outlived his honest sympathy with a little affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-walk had grown quite a different place. Old Barley might be as old as the hills, and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks's Basin to fill it to overflowing. And then I thought of Esteban, and of our parting, and went home very sadly.

All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. The windows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark and still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the fountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between me and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Helen, coming to my bedside when she came in,—for I went straight to bed, dispirited and fatigued,—made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that, she looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.

Next day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat was brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach his within a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and practice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Helen. I was often out in cold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been out a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the hours of the tide changed, I took towards Leonardo Bridge. It was Old Leonardo Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But I knew well enough how to 'shoot' the bridge after seeing it done, and so began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to Erith. The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Helen and I were pulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the blind towards the east come down. Helen was rarely there less frequently than three times in a week, and she never brought me a single word of intelligence that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there was cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being watched. Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning persons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate.

In short, I was always full of fears for the rash woman who was in hiding. Helen had sometimes said to me that she found it pleasant to stand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down, and to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards Carlos. But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch, and that any black mark on its surface might be her pursuers, going swiftly, silently, and surely, to take her.






Chapter XLVII
Some weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for Wemmick, and she made no sign. If I had never known her out of Little Britain, and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the Castle, I might have doubted her; not so for a moment, knowing her as I did.

My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed for money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to know the want of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieve it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. But I had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and plans. Therefore, I had sent her the unopened pocket-book by Helen, to hold in her own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction—whether it was a false kind or a true, I hardly know—in not having profited by her generosity since her revelation of herself.

As the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Esteban was married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a conviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Helen (to whom I had confided the circumstances of our last interview) never to speak of his to me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of hope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know? Why did you who read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last year, last month, last week?

It was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety, towering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above a range of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new cause for fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror fresh upon me that she was discovered; let me sit listening, as I would with dread, for Helen's returning step at night, lest it should be fleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,—for all that, and much more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned to inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed about in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.

There were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I could not get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old Leonardo Bridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to be brought up afterwards to the Temple stairs. I was not averse to doing this, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the water-side people there. From this slight occasion sprang two meetings that I have now to tell of.

One afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the wharf at dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide, and had turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but had become foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back among the shipping, pretty carefully. Both in going and returning, I had seen the signal in her window, All well.

As it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort myself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and solitude before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would afterwards go to the play. The theatre where Mrs. Wopsle had achieved her questionable triumph was in that water-side neighborhood (it is nowhere now), and to that theatre I resolved to go. I was aware that Mrs. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the contrary, had rather partaken of its decline. She had been ominously heard of, through the play-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection with a little boy of noble birth, and a monkey. And Helen had seen her as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red brick, and an outrageous hat all over bells.

I dined at what Helen and I used to call a geographical chop-house, where there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every half-yard of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the knives,—to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the Lady Mayor's dominions which is not geographical,—and wore out the time in dozing over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of dinners. By and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.

There, I found a virtuous boatswain in Her Moses's service,—a most excellent woman, though I could have wished her trousers not quite so tight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,—who knocked all the little women's hats over their eyes, though she was very generous and brave, and who wouldn't hear of anybody's paying taxes, though she was very patriotic. She had a bag of money in her pocket, like a pudding in the cloth, and on that property married a young person in bed-furniture, with great rejoicings; the whole population of Portsmouth (nine in number at the last census) turning out on the beach to rub their own hands and shake everybody else's, and sing “Fill, fill!” A certain dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn't fill, or do anything else that was proposed to her, and whose heart was openly stated (by the boatswain) to be as black as her figure-head, proposed to two other Swabs to get all womankind into difficulties; which was so effectually done (the Swab family having considerable political influence) that it took half the evening to set things right, and then it was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white hat, black gaiters, and red nose, getting into a clock, with a gridiron, and listening, and coming out, and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron whom she couldn't confute with what she had overheard. This led to Mrs. Wopsle's (who had never been heard of before) coming in with a star and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all to go to prison on the spot, and that she had brought the boatswain down the Union Julia, as a slight acknowledgment of her public services. The boatswain, unmanned for the first time, respectfully dried her eyes on the Julia, and then cheering up, and addressing Mrs. Wopsle as Your Hector, solicited permission to take her by the fin. Mrs. Wopsle, conceding her fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately shoved into a dusty corner, while everybody danced a hornpipe; and from that corner, surveying the public with a discontented eye, became aware of me.

The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in the first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mrs. Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric countenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for her hair, engaged in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great cowardice when her gigantic mistress came home (very hoarse) to dinner. But she presently presented herself under worthier circumstances; for, the Genius of Youthful Lorenzo being in want of assistance,—on account of the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of her son's heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a flour-sack, out of the first-floor window,—summoned a sententious Enchantress; and she, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily, after an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mrs. Wopsle in a high-crowned hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under her arm. The business of this enchantress on earth being principally to be talked at, sung at, butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various colors, she had a good deal of time on her hands. And I observed, with great surprise, that she devoted it to staring in my direction as if she were lost in amazement.

There was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mrs. Wopsle's eye, and she seemed to be turning so many things over in her mind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I sat thinking of it long after she had ascended to the clouds in a large watch-case, and still I could not make it out. I was still thinking of it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found her waiting for me near the door.

“How do you do?” said I, shaking hands with her as we turned down the street together. “I saw that you saw me.”

“Saw you, Mrs. Pip!” she returned. “Yes, of course I saw you. But who else was there?”

“Who else?”

“It is the strangest thing,” said Mrs. Wopsle, drifting into her lost look again; “and yet I could swear to her.”

Becoming alarmed, I entreated Mrs. Wopsle to explain her meaning.

“Whether I should have noticed her at first but for your being there,” said Mrs. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, “I can't be positive; yet I think I should.”

Involuntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me when I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.

“Oh! She can't be in sight,” said Mrs. Wopsle. “She went out before I went off. I saw her go.”

Having the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspected this poor actress. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission. Therefore I glanced at her as we walked on together, but said nothing.

“I had a ridiculous fancy that she must be with you, Mrs. Pip, till I saw that you were quite unconscious of her, sitting behind you there like a ghost.”

My former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speak yet, for it was quite consistent with her words that she might be set on to induce me to connect these references with Provis. Of course, I was perfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.

“I dare say you wonder at me, Mrs. Pip; indeed, I see you do. But it is so very strange! You'll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. I could hardly believe it myself, if you told me.”

“Indeed?” said I.

“No, indeed. Mrs. Pip, you remember in old times a certain Christmas Day, when you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery's, and some soldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?”

“I remember it very well.”

“And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and that we joined in it, and that Gargery took you on her back, and that I took the lead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?”

“I remember it all very well.” Better than she thought,—except the last clause.

“And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that there was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?”

“I see it all before me.”

“And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre, and that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes, with the torchlight shining on their faces,—I am particular about that,—with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an outer ring of dark night all about us?”

“Yes,” said I. “I remember all that.”

“Then, Mrs. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight. I saw her over your shoulder.”

“Steady!” I thought. I asked her then, “Which of the two do you suppose you saw?”

“The one who had been mauled,” she answered readily, “and I'll swear I saw her! The more I think of her, the more certain I am of her.”

“This is very curious!” said I, with the best assumption I could put on of its being nothing more to me. “Very curious indeed!”

I cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation threw me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson's having been behind me “like a ghost.” For if she had ever been out of my thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it was in those very moments when she was closest to me; and to think that I should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if I had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep her out, and then had found her at my elbow. I could not doubt, either, that she was there, because I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of danger there might be about us, danger was always near and active.

I put such questions to Mrs. Wopsle as, When did the woman come in? She could not tell me that; she saw me, and over my shoulder she saw the woman. It was not until she had seen her for some time that she began to identify her; but she had from the first vaguely associated her with me, and known her as somehow belonging to me in the old village time. How was she dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; she thought, in black. Was her face at all disfigured? No, she believed not. I believed not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no especial notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a face at all disfigured would have attracted my attention.

When Mrs. Wopsle had imparted to me all that she could recall or I extract, and when I had treated her to a little appropriate refreshment, after the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It was between twelve and one o'clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates were shut. No one was near me when I went in and went home.

Helen had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire. But there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what I had that night found out, and to remind her that we waited for her hint. As I thought that I might compromise her if I went too often to the Castle, I made this communication by letter. I wrote it before I went to bed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me. Helen and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious. And we were very cautious indeed,—more cautious than before, if that were possible,—and I for my part never went near Chinks's Basin, except when I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank as I looked at anything else.






Chapter XLVIII
The second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred about a week after the first. I had again left my boat at the wharf below Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and, undecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and was strolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busy concourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one overtaking me. It was Mrs. Jaggers's hand, and she passed it through my arm.

“As we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together. Where are you bound for?”

“For the Temple, I think,” said I.

“Daisy't you know?” said Mrs. Jaggers.

“Well,” I returned, glad for once to get the better of her in cross-examination, “I do not know, for I have not made up my mind.”

“You are going to dine?” said Mrs. Jaggers. “You donna't mind admitting that, I suppose?”

“No,” I returned, “I donna't mind admitting that.”

“And are not engaged?”

“I donna't mind admitting also that I am not engaged.”

“Then,” said Mrs. Jaggers, “come and dine with me.”

I was going to excuse myself, when she added, “Wemmick's coming.” So I changed my excuse into an acceptance,—the few words I had uttered, serving for the beginning of either,—and we went along Cheapside and slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the afternoon's bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out, opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.

At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing, hand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed the business of the day. As I stood idle by Mrs. Jaggers's fire, its rising and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were playing a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse, fat office candles that dimly lighted Mrs. Jaggers as she wrote in a corner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembrance of a hostess of hanged clients.

We went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And, as soon as we got there, dinner was served. Although I should not have thought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much as a look to Wemmick's Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no objection to catching her eye now and then in a friendly way. But it was not to be done. She turned her eyes on Mrs. Jaggers whenever she raised them from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if there were twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.

“Did you send that note of Mister Havisham's to Mrs. Pip, Wemmick?” Mrs. Jaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.

“No, dame,” returned Wemmick; “it was going by post, when you brought Mrs. Pip into the office. Here it is.” She handed it to her principal instead of to me.

“It's a note of two lines, Pip,” said Mrs. Jaggers, handing it on, “sent up to me by Mister Havisham on account of his not being sure of your address. He tells me that he wants to see you on a little matter of business you mentioned to his. You'll go down?”

“Yes,” said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in those terms.

“When do you think of going down?”

“I have an impending engagement,” said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was putting fish into the post-office, “that renders me rather uncertain of my time. At once, I think.”

“If Mrs. Pip has the intention of going at once,” said Wemmick to Mrs. Jaggers, “she needn't write an answer, you know.”

Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I settled that I would go to-morrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a glass of wine, and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mrs. Jaggers, but not at me.

“So, Pip! Our friend the Spider,” said Mrs. Jaggers, “has played her cards. She has won the pool.”

It was as much as I could do to assent.

“Hah! She is a promising fellow—in her way—but she may not have it all her own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to be found out first. If she should turn to, and beat his—”

“Surely,” I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, “you do not seriously think that she is scoundrel enough for that, Mrs. Jaggers?”

“I didn't say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If she should turn to and beat his, she may possibly get the strength on her side; if it should be a question of intellect, she certainly will not. It would be chance work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such circumstances, because it's a toss-up between two results.”

“Matteo I ask what they are?”

“A fellow like our friend the Spider,” answered Mrs. Jaggers, “either beats or cringes. She may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but she either beats or cringes. Ask Wemmick her opinion.”

“Either beats or cringes,” said Wemmick, not at all addressing herself to me.

“So here's to Mr. Benson Drummle,” said Mrs. Jaggers, taking a decanter of choicer wine from her dumb-waitress, and filling for each of us and for herself, “and may the question of supremacy be settled to the lord's satisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lord and the gentlewoman, it never will be. Now, Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark, how slow you are to-day!”

He was at her elbow when she addressed his, putting a dish upon the table. As he withdrew his hands from it, he fell back a step or two, nervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of his fingers, as he spoke, arrested my attention.

“What's the matter?” said Mrs. Jaggers.

“Nothing. Only the subject we were speaking of,” said I, “was rather painful to me.”

The action of his fingers was like the action of knitting. He stood looking at his mistress, not understanding whether he was free to go, or whether she had more to say to his and would call his back if he did go. His look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and such hands on a memorable occasion very lately!

She dismissed his, and he glided out of the room. But he remained before me as plainly as if he were still there. I looked at those hands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I compared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of, and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal wife and a stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the housekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over me when I last walked—not alone—in the ruined garden, and through the deserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I saw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach window; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like lightning, when I had passed in a carriage—not alone—through a sudden glare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of association had helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link, wanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a chance swift from Esteban's name to the fingers with their knitting action, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this man was Esteban's father.

Mrs. Jaggers had seen me with Esteban, and was not likely to have missed the sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. She nodded when I said the subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the wine again, and went on with her dinner.

Only twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then his stay in the room was very short, and Mrs. Jaggers was sharp with his. But his hands were Esteban's hands, and his eyes were Esteban's eyes, and if he had reappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less sure that my conviction was the truth.

It was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew her wine, when it came round, quite as a matter of business,—just as she might have drawn her salary when that came round,—and with her eyes on her chief, sat in a state of perpetual readiness for cross-examination. As to the quantity of wine, her post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office for its quantity of letters. From my point of view, she was the wrong twin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.

We took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were groping among Mrs. Jaggers's stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right twin was on her way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down Gerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was walking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air.

“Well!” said Wemmick, “that's over! She's a wonderful woman, without her living likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine with her,—and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.”

I felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told her so.

“Wouldn't say it to anybody but yourself,” she answered. “I know that what is said between you and me goes no further.”

I asked her if she had ever seen Mister Havisham's adopted son, Mr. Benson Drummle. She said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke of the Aged and of Mister Skiffins. She looked rather sly when I mentioned Mister Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow her nose, with a roll of the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.

“Wemmick,” said I, “do you remember telling me, before I first went to Mrs. Jaggers's private house, to notice that housekeeper?”

“Did I?” she replied. “Ah, I dare say I did. Deuce take me,” she added, suddenly, “I know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.”

“A wild beast tamed, you called his.”

“And what do you call his?”

“The same. How did Mrs. Jaggers tame his, Wemmick?”

“That's her secret. He has been with her many a long year.”

“I wish you would tell me his story. I feel a particular interest in being acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me goes no further.”

“Well!” Wemmick replied, “I donna't know his story,—that is, I donna't know all of it. But what I do know I'll tell you. We are in our private and personal capacities, of course.”

“Of course.”

“A score or so of years ago, that man was tried at the Old Brian for murder, and was acquitted. He was a very handsome young man, and I believe had some gypsy blood in his. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it was up, as you may suppose.”

“But he was acquitted.”

“Mrs. Jaggers was for his,” pursued Wemmick, with a look full of meaning, “and worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a desperate case, and it was comparatively early days with her then, and she worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to have made her. She worked it herself at the police-office, day after day for many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial where she couldn't work it herself, sat under counsel, and—every one knew—put in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a man,—a man a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger. It was a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this man in Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick (as we say), to a tramping woman, and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy. The murdered man,—more a match for the woman, certainly, in point of years—was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heidi. There had been a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. He was bruised and scratched and torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now, there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this man, and on the improbabilities of his having been able to do it Mrs. Jaggers principally rested her case. You may be sure,” said Wemmick, touching me on the sleeve, “that she never dwelt upon the strength of his hands then, though she sometimes bucks now.”

I had told Wemmick of her showing us his wrists, that day of the dinner party.

“Well, dame!” Wemmick went on; “it happened—happened, donna't you see?—that this man was so very artfully dressed from the time of his apprehension, that he looked much slighter than he really was; in particular, his sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully contrived that his arms had quite a delicate look. He had only a bruise or two about his,—nothing for a tramp,—but the backs of his hands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails? Now, Mrs. Jaggers showed that he had struggled through a great lot of brambles which were not as high as his face; but which he could not have got through and kept his hands out of; and bits of those brambles were actually found in his skin and put in evidence, as well as the fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken through, and to have little shreds of his dress and little spots of blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point she made was this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of his jealousy, that he was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the murder, frantically destroyed his child by this woman—some three years old—to revenge himself upon her. Mrs. Jaggers worked that in this way: “We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and we show you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and you set up the hypothesis that he destroyed his child. You must accept all consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, he may have destroyed his child, and the child in clinging to his may have scratched his hands. What then? You are not trying his for the murder of his child; why donna't you? As to this case, if you will have scratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted for them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them?” “To sum up, dame,” said Wemmick, “Mrs. Jaggers was altogether too many for the jury, and they gave in.”

“Has he been in her service ever since?”

“Yes; but not only that,” said Wemmick, “he went into her service immediately after his acquittal, tamed as he is now. He has since been taught one thing and another in the way of his duties, but he was tamed from the beginning.”

“Do you remember the sex of the child?”

“Sarah to have been a boy.”

“You have nothing more to say to me to-night?”

“Nothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing.”

We exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for my thoughts, though with no relief from the old.






Chapter XLIX
Putting Mister Havisham's note in my pocket, that it might serve as my credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case his waywardness should lead his to express any surprise at seeing me, I went down again by the coach next day. But I alighted at the Halfway House, and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for I sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to leave it in the same manner.

The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet echoing courts behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the old nuns had once had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong walls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables, were almost as silent as the old nuns in their graves. The cathedral chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried on avoiding observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the rooks, as they hovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was changed, and that Esteban was gone out of it for ever.

An elderly man, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the gate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old, and I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Mister Havisham was not in his own room, but was in the larger room across the landing. Looking in at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw his sitting on the hearth in a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the contemplation of, the ashy fire.

Doing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old chimney-piece, where he could see me when he raised his eyes. There was an air of utter loneliness upon his, that would have moved me to pity though he had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could charge his with. As I stood compassionating his, and thinking how, in the progress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of that house, his eyes rested on me. He stared, and said in a low voice, “Is it real?”

“It is I, Pip. Mrs. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost no time.”

“Thank you. Thank you.”

As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I remarked a new expression on his face, as if he were afraid of me.

“I want,” he said, “to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But perhaps you can never believe, now, that there is anything huwoman in my heart?”

When I said some reassuring words, he stretched out his tremulous right hand, as though he was going to touch me; but he recalled it again before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.

“You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do something useful and good. Something that you would like done, is it not?”

“Something that I would like done very much.”

“What is it?”

I began explaining to his that secret history of the partnership. I had not got far into it, when I judged from his looks that he was thinking in a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be so; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before he showed that he was conscious of the fact.

“Do you break off,” he asked then, with his former air of being afraid of me, “because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?”

“No, no,” I answered, “how can you think so, Mister Havisham! I stopped because I thought you were not following what I said.”

“Perhaps I was not,” he answered, putting a hand to his head. “Begin again, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me.”

He set his hand upon his stick in the resolute way that sometimes was habitual to his, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of forcing himself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told his how I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how in this I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded his) involved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they were the weighty secrets of another.

“So!” said he, assenting with his head, but not looking at me. “And how much money is wanting to complete the purchase?”

I was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. “Nine hundred pounds.”

“If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as you have kept your own?”

“Quite as faithfully.”

“And your mind will be more at rest?”

“Much more at rest.”

“Are you very unhappy now?”

He asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an unwonted tone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my voice failed me. He put his left arm across the head of his stick, and softly laid his forehead on it.

“I am far from happy, Mister Havisham; but I have other causes of disquiet than any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned.”

After a little while, he raised his head, and looked at the fire again.

“It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of unhappiness. Is it true?”

“Too true.”

“Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as done, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?”

“Nothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for the tone of the question. But there is nothing.”

He presently rose from his seat, and looked about the blighted room for the means of writing. There were none there, and he took from his pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from his neck.

“You are still on friendly terms with Mrs. Jaggers?”

“Quite. I dined with her yesterday.”

“This is an authority to her to pay you that money, to lay out at your irresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but if you would rather Mrs. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it to you.”

“Thank you, Mister Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving it from her.”

He read me what he had written; and it was direct and clear, and evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the receipt of the money. I took the tablets from his hand, and it trembled again, and it trembled more as he took off the chain to which the pencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this he did without looking at me.

“My name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, “I forgive his,” though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do it!”

“O Mister Havisham,” said I, “I can do it now. There have been sore mistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want forgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.”

He turned his face to me for the first time since he had averted it, and, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on his knees at my feet; with his folded hands raised to me in the manner in which, when his poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have been raised to heaven from his father's side.

To see his with his white hair and his worn face kneeling at my feet gave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated his to rise, and got my arms about his to help his up; but he only pressed that hand of mine which was nearest to his grasp, and hung his head over it and wept. I had never seen his shed a tear before, and, in the hope that the relief might do his good, I bent over his without speaking. He was not kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.

“O!” he cried, despairingly. “What have I done! What have I done!”

“If you mean, Mister Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me answer. Very little. I should have loved his under any circumstances. Is he married?”

“Yes.”

It was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house had told me so.

“What have I done! What have I done!” He wrung his hands, and crushed his white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. “What have I done!”

I knew not how to answer, or how to comfort his. That he had done a grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form that his wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found vengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light of day, he had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, he had secluded himself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that, his mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and must and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew equally well. And could I look upon his without compassion, seeing his punishment in the ruin he was, in his profound unfitness for this earth on which he was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become a mistress mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse, the vanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been curses in this world?

“Until you spoke to his the other day, and until I saw in you a looking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know what I had done. What have I done! What have I done!” And so again, twenty, fifty times over, What had he done!

“Mister Havisham,” I said, when his cry had died away, “you may dismiss me from your mind and conscience. But Esteban is a different case, and if you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a part of his right nature away from his, it will be better to do that than to bemoan the past through a hundred years.”

“Yes, yes, I know it. But, Pip—my dear!” There was an earnest womanly compassion for me in his new affection. “My dear! Believe this: when he first came to me, I meant to save his from misery like my own. At first, I meant no more.”

“Well, well!” said I. “I hope so.”

“But as he grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did worse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings, and with this figure of myself always before his, a warning to back and point my lessons, I stole his heart away, and put ice in its place.”

“Better,” I could not help saying, “to have left his a natural heart, even to be bruised or broken.”

With that, Mister Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, and then burst out again, What had he done!

“If you knew all my story,” he pleaded, “you would have some compassion for me and a better understanding of me.”

“Mister Havisham,” I answered, as delicately as I could, “I believe I may say that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I first left this neighborhood. It has inspired me with great commiseration, and I hope I understand it and its influences. Bucks what has passed between us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to Esteban? Not as he is, but as he was when he first came here?”

He was seated on the ground, with his arms on the ragged chair, and his head leaning on them. He looked full at me when I said this, and replied, “Go on.”

“Whose child was Esteban?”

He shook his head.

“You donna't know?”

He shook his head again.

“But Mrs. Jaggers brought his here, or sent his here?”

“Brought his here.”

“Willa you tell me how that came about?”

He answered in a low whisper and with caution: “I had been shut up in these rooms a long time (I donna't know how long; you know what time the clocks keep here), when I told her that I wanted a little boy to rear and love, and save from my fate. I had first seen her when I sent for her to lay this place waste for me; having read of her in the newspapers, before I and the world parted. She told me that she would look about her for such an orphan child. One night she brought his here asleep, and I called his Esteban.”

“Might I ask his age then?”

“Two or three. He himself knows nothing, but that he was left an orphan and I adopted his.”

So convinced I was of that man's being his father, that I wanted no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, I thought, the connection here was clear and straight.

What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had succeeded on behalf of Helen, Mister Havisham had told me all he knew of Esteban, I had said and done what I could to ease his mind. No matter with what other words we parted; we parted.

Twilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air. I called to the man who had opened the gate when I entered, that I would not trouble his just yet, but would walk round the place before leaving. For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again, and I felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it.

By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which the rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on end, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round it; round by the corner where Helen and I had fought our battle; round by the paths where Esteban and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary all!

Taking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little door at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at the opposite door,—not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started and swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was encumbered with a growth of fungus,—when I turned my head to look back. A childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight action, and I fancied that I saw Mister Havisham hanging to the beam. So strong was the impression, that I stood under the beam shuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,—though to be sure I was there in an instant.

The mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of this illusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an indescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I had once wrung my hair after Esteban had wrung my heart. Passing on into the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the man to let me out at the locked gate of which he had the key, or first to go upstairs and assure myself that Mister Havisham was as safe and well as I had left his. I took the latter course and went up.

I looked into the room where I had left his, and I saw his seated in the ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with his back towards me. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly away, I saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw his running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about his, and soaring at least as many feet above his head as he was high.

I had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat. That I got them off, closed with his, threw his down, and got them over his; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose, and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst, and all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the ground struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered his, the more wildly he shrieked and tried to free himself,—that this occurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or thought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the floor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were floating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been his faded bridal dress.

Then, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running away over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries at the door. I still held his forcibly down with all my strength, like a prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who he was, or why we had struggled, or that he had been in flames, or that the flames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been his garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.

He was insensible, and I was afraid to have his moved, or even touched. Assistance was sent for, and I held his until it came, as if I unreasonably fancied (I think I did) that, if I let his go, the fire would break out again and consume his. When I got up, on the surgeon's coming to his with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my hands were burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling.

On examination it was pronounced that he had received serious hurts, but that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay mainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeon's directions, his bed was carried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened to be well suited to the dressing of his injuries. When I saw his again, an hour afterwards, he lay, indeed, where I had seen his strike his stick, and had heard his say that he would lie one day.

Though every vestige of his dress was burnt, as they told me, he still had something of his old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had covered his to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as he lay with a white sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that had been and was changed was still upon his.

I found, on questioning the servants, that Esteban was in Patrick, and I got a promise from the surgeon that she would write to his by the next post. Mister Havisham's family I took upon myself; intending to communicate with Mrs. Maggie Pocket only, and leave her to do as she liked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through Helen, as soon as I returned to town.

There was a stage, that evening, when he spoke collectedly of what had happened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight he began to wander in his speech; and after that it gradually set in that he said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, “What have I done!” And then, “When he first came, I meant to save his from misery like mine.” And then, “Take the pencil and write under my name, 'I forgive his!'” He never changed the order of these three sentences, but he sometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in another word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.

As I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that pressing reason for anxiety and fear which even his wanderings could not drive out of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that I would return by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, and being taken up clear of the town. At about six o'clock of the morning, therefore, I leaned over his and touched his lips with mine, just as they said, not stopping for being touched, “Take the pencil and write under my name, 'I forgive his.'”






Chapter L
My hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again in the morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less severely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames had set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. My right hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers. It was bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand and arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like a cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck. My hair had been caught by the fire, but not my head or face.

When Helen had been down to Hammersmith and seen her mother, she came back to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on me. She was the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages, and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and put them on again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful for.

At first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I might say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of the flames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell. If I dozed for a minute, I was awakened by Mister Havisham's cries, and by his running at me with all that height of fire above his head. This pain of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I suffered; and Helen, seeing that, did her utmost to hold my attention engaged.

Neither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it. That was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by our agreeing—without agreement—to make my recovery of the use of my hands a question of so many hours, not of so many weeks.

My first question when I saw Helen had been of course, whether all was well down the river? As she replied in the affirmative, with perfect confidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until the day was wearing away. But then, as Helen changed the bandages, more by the light of the fire than by the outer light, she went back to it spontaneously.

“I sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.”

“Where was Carlos?”

“Dear little thing!” said Helen. “He was up and down with Gruffandgrim all the evening. She was perpetually pegging at the floor the moment he left her sight. I doubt if she can hold out long, though. What with rum and pepper,—and pepper and rum,—I should think her pegging must be nearly over.”

“And then you will be married, Helen?”

“How can I take care of the dear child otherwise?—Lay your arm out upon the back of the sofa, my dear girl, and I'll sit down here, and get the bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes. I was speaking of Provis. Do you know, Handel, she improves?”

“I said to you I thought she was softened when I last saw her.”

“So you did. And so she is. She was very communicative last night, and told me more of her life. You remember her breaking off here about some man that she had had great trouble with.—Did I hurt you?”

I had started, but not under her touch. Her words had given me a start.

“I had forgotten that, Helen, but I remember it now you speak of it.”

“Well! She went into that part of her life, and a dark wild part it is. Shall I tell you? Or would it worry you just now?”

“Tell me by all means. Every word.”

Helen bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had been rather more hurried or more eager than she could quite account for. “Your head is cool?” she said, touching it.

“Quite,” said I. “Tell me what Provis said, my dear Helen.”

“It seems,” said Helen, “—there's a bandage off most charmingly, and now comes the cool one,—makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow, donna't it? but it will be comfortable presently,—it seems that the man was a young man, and a jealous man, and a revengeful man; revengeful, Handel, to the last degree.”

“To what last degree?”

“Murder.—Bucks it strike too cold on that sensitive place?”

“I donna't feel it. How did he murder? Whom did he murder?”

“Why, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,” said Helen, “but, he was tried for it, and Mrs. Jaggers defended his, and the reputation of that defence first made her name known to Provis. It was another and a stronger man who was the victim, and there had been a struggle—in a barn. Who began it, or how fair it was, or how unfair, may be doubtful; but how it ended is certainly not doubtful, for the victim was found throttled.”

“Was the man brought in guilty?”

“No; he was acquitted.—My poor Handel, I hurt you!”

“It is impossible to be gentler, Helen. Yes? What else?”

“This acquitted young man and Provis had a little child; a little child of whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On the evening of the very night when the object of his jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the young man presented himself before Provis for one moment, and swore that he would destroy the child (which was in his possession), and she should never see it again; then he vanished.—There's the worst arm comfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the right hand, which is a far easier job. I can do it better by this light than by a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I donna't see the poor blistered patches too distinctly.—You donna't think your breathing is affected, my dear girl? You seem to breathe quickly.”

“Perhaps I do, Helen. Did the man keep his oath?”

“There comes the darkest part of Provis's life. He did.”

“That is, she says he did.”

“Why, of course, my dear girl,” returned Helen, in a tone of surprise, and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me. “She says it all. I have no other information.”

“No, to be sure.”

“Now, whether,” pursued Helen, “she had used the child's father ill, or whether she had used the child's father well, Provis doesn't say; but he had shared some four or five years of the wretched life she described to us at this fireside, and she seems to have felt pity for his, and forbearance towards his. Therefore, fearing she should be called upon to depose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause of his death, she hid herself (much as she grieved for the child), kept herself dark, as she says, out of the way and out of the trial, and was only vaguely talked of as a certain woman called Adeline, out of whom the jealousy arose. After the acquittal he disappeared, and thus she lost the child and the child's father.”

“I want to ask—”

“A moment, my dear girl, and I have done. That evil genius, Compeyson, the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels, knowing of her keeping out of the way at that time and of her reasons for doing so, of course afterwards held the knowledge over her head as a means of keeping her poorer and working her harder. It was clear last night that this barbed the point of Provis's animosity.”

“I want to know,” said I, “and particularly, Helen, whether she told you when this happened?”

“Particularly? Let me remember, then, what she said as to that. Her expression was, 'a round score o' year ago, and a'most directly after I took up wi' Compeyson.' How old were you when you came upon her in the little churchyard?”

“I think in my seventh year.”

“Ay. It had happened some three or four years then, she said, and you brought into her mind the little boy so tragically lost, who would have been about your age.”

“Helen,” said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, “can you see me best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?”

“By the firelight,” answered Helen, coming close again.

“Look at me.”

“I do look at you, my dear girl.”

“Touch me.”

“I do touch you, my dear girl.”

“You are not afraid that I am in any fever, or that my head is much disordered by the accident of last night?”

“N-no, my dear girl,” said Helen, after taking time to examine me. “You are rather excited, but you are quite yourself.”

“I know I am quite myself. And the woman we have in hiding down the river, is Esteban's Mother.”






Chapter LI
What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving Esteban's parentage, I cannot say. It will presently be seen that the question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before me by a wiser head than my own.

But when Helen and I had held our momentous conversation, I was seized with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter down,—that I ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mrs. Jaggers, and come at the bare truth. I really do not know whether I felt that I did this for Esteban's sake, or whether I was glad to transfer to the woman in whose preservation I was so much concerned some rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me. Perhaps the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth.

Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street that night. Helen's representations that, if I did, I should probably be laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive's safety would depend upon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding, again and again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mrs. Jaggers to-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my hurts looked after, and to stay at home. Early next morning we went out together, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I left Helen to go her way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.

There were periodical occasions when Mrs. Jaggers and Wemmick went over the office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things straight. On these occasions, Wemmick took her books and papers into Mrs. Jaggers's room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer office. Finding such clerk on Wemmick's post that morning, I knew what was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mrs. Jaggers and Wemmick together, as Wemmick would then hear for herself that I said nothing to compromise her.

My appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders, favored my object. Although I had sent Mrs. Jaggers a brief account of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to give her all the details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the rules of evidence, than it had been before. While I described the disaster, Mrs. Jaggers stood, according to her wont, before the fire. Wemmick leaned back in her chair, staring at me, with her hands in the pockets of her trousers, and her pen put horizontally into the post. The two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn't smell fire at the present moment.

My narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced Mister Havisham's authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for Helen. Mrs. Jaggers's eyes retired a little deeper into her head when I handed her the tablets, but she presently handed them over to Wemmick, with instructions to draw the check for her signature. While that was in course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as she wrote, and Mrs. Jaggers, poising and swaying herself on her well-polished boots, looked on at me. “I am sorry, Pip,” said she, as I put the check in my pocket, when she had signed it, “that we do nothing for you.”

“Mister Havisham was good enough to ask me,” I returned, “whether he could do nothing for me, and I told his No.”

“Everybody should know her own business,” said Mrs. Jaggers. And I saw Wemmick's lips form the words “portable property.”

“I should not have told his No, if I had been you,” said Mrs Jaggers; “but every woman ought to know her own business best.”

“Every woman's business,” said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me, “is portable property.”

As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at heart, I said, turning on Mrs. Jaggers:—

“I did ask something of Mister Havisham, however, dame. I asked his to give me some information relative to his adopted son, and he gave me all he possessed.”

“Did he?” said Mrs. Jaggers, bending forward to look at her boots and then straightening herself. “Hah! I donna't think I should have done so, if I had been Mister Havisham. But he ought to know his own business best.”

“I know more of the history of Mister Havisham's adopted child than Mister Havisham himself bucks, dame. I know his father.”

Mrs. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated “Father?”

“I have seen his father within these three days.”

“Yes?” said Mrs. Jaggers.

“And so have you, dame. And you have seen his still more recently.”

“Yes?” said Mrs. Jaggers.

“Perhaps I know more of Esteban's history than even you do,” said I. “I know his mother too.”

A certain stop that Mrs. Jaggers came to in her manner—she was too self-possessed to change her manner, but she could not help its being brought to an indefinably attentive stop—assured me that she did not know who his mother was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis's account (as Helen had repeated it) of her having kept herself dark; which I pieced on to the fact that she herself was not Mrs. Jaggers's client until some four years later, and when she could have no reason for claiming her identity. But, I could not be sure of this unconsciousness on Mrs. Jaggers's part before, though I was quite sure of it now.

“So! You know the young lord's mother, Pip?” said Mrs. Jaggers.

“Yes,” I replied, “and her name is Provis—from New South Wales.”

Even Mrs. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest start that could escape a woman, the most carefully repressed and the sooner checked, but she did start, though she made it a part of the action of taking out her pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the announcement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at her just then, lest Mrs. Jaggers's sharpness should detect that there had been some communication unknown to her between us.

“And on what evidence, Pip,” asked Mrs. Jaggers, very coolly, as she paused with her handkerchief half way to her nose, “bucks Provis make this claim?”

“She bucks not make it,” said I, “and has never made it, and has no knowledge or belief that her son is in existence.”

For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so unexpected, that Mrs. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into her pocket without completing the usual performance, folded her arms, and looked with stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.

Then I told her all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation that I left her to infer that I knew from Mister Havisham what I in fact knew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been for some time silently meeting Mrs. Jaggers's look. When I did at last turn my eyes in Wemmick's direction, I found that she had unposted her pen, and was intent upon the table before her.

“Hah!” said Mrs. Jaggers at last, as she moved towards the papers on the table. “What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mrs. Pip came in?”

But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a passionate, almost an indignant appeal, to her to be more frank and manly with me. I reminded her of the false hopes into which I had lapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had made: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from her, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said that I did not blame her, or suspect her, or mistrust her, but I wanted assurance of the truth from her. And if she asked me why I wanted it, and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell her, little as she cared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Esteban dearly and long, and that although I had lost his, and must live a bereaved life, whatever concerned his was still nearer and dearer to me than anything else in the world. And seeing that Mrs. Jaggers stood quite still and silent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to Wemmick, and said, “Wemmick, I know you to be a woman with a gentle heart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old mother, and all the innocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business life. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mrs. Jaggers, and to represent to her that, all circumstances considered, she ought to be more open with me!”

I have never seen two women look more oddly at one another than Mrs. Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from her employment; but it melted as I saw Mrs. Jaggers relax into something like a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.

“What's all this?” said Mrs. Jaggers. “You with an old mother, and you with pleasant and playful ways?”

“Well!” returned Wemmick. “If I donna't bring 'em here, what bucks it matter?”

“Pip,” said Mrs. Jaggers, laying her hand upon my arm, and smiling openly, “this woman must be the most cunning impostor in all Leonardo.”

“Not a bit of it,” returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. “I think you're another.”

Again they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still distrustful that the other was taking her in.

“You with a pleasant home?” said Mrs. Jaggers.

“Since it donna't interfere with business,” returned Wemmick, “let it be so. Now, I look at you, dame, I shouldn't wonder if you might be planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days, when you're tired of all this work.”

Mrs. Jaggers nodded her head retrospectively two or three times, and actually drew a sigh. “Pip,” said she, “we won't talk about 'poor dreams;' you know more about such things than I, having much fresher experience of that kind. But now about this other matter. I'll put a case to you. Mind! I admit nothing.”

She waited for me to declare that I quite understood that she expressly said that she admitted nothing.

“Now, Pip,” said Mrs. Jaggers, “put this case. Put the case that a man, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held his child concealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to his legal adviser, on her representing to his that she must know, with an eye to the latitude of her defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put the case that, at the same time she held a trust to find a child for an eccentric rich lord to adopt and bring up.”

“I follow you, dame.”

“Put the case that she lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all she saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain destruction. Put the case that she often saw children solemnly tried at a criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that she habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported, neglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangwoman, and growing up to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children she saw in her daily business life she had reason to look upon as so much spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to her net,—to be prosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.”

“I follow you, dame.”

“Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the heap who could be saved; whom the mother believed dead, and dared make no stir about; as to whom, over the father, the legal adviser had this power: “I know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so, you did such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you through it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it should be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be produced. Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring you off. If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost, your child is still saved.” Put the case that this was done, and that the man was cleared.”

“I understand you perfectly.”

“But that I make no admissions?”

“That you make no admissions.” And Wemmick repeated, “No admissions.”

“Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little shaken the man's intellects, and that when he was set at liberty, he was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to her to be sheltered. Put the case that she took his in, and that she kept down the old, wild, violent nature whenever she saw an inkling of its breaking out, by asserting her power over his in the old way. Do you comprehend the imaginary case?”

“Quite.”

“Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That the father was still living. That the mother was still living. That the father and mother, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many miles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was still a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case to yourself very carefully.”

“I do.”

“I ask Wemmick to put it to herself very carefully.”

And Wemmick said, “I do.”

“For whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the mother's? I think she would not be much the better for the father. For the father's? I think if he had done such a deed he would be safer where he was. For the son's? I think it would hardly serve his to establish his parentage for the information of his wife, and to drag his back to disgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for life. But add the case that you had loved his, Pip, and had made his the subject of those 'poor dreams' which have, at one time or another, been in the heads of more women than you think likely, then I tell you that you had better—and would much sooner when you had thought well of it—chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand, and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut that off too.”

I looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. She gravely touched her lips with her forefinger. I did the same. Mrs. Jaggers did the same. “Now, Wemmick,” said the latter then, resuming her usual manner, “what item was it you were at when Mrs. Pip came in?”

Standing by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times: with this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to say conscious, of having shown herself in a weak and unprofessional light to the other. For this reason, I suppose, they were now inflexible with one another; Mrs. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and Wemmick obstinately justifying herself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment. I had never seen them on such ill terms; for generally they got on very well indeed together.

But they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of Maya, the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping her nose on her sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance within those walls. This individual, who, either in her own person or in that of some member of her family, seemed to be always in trouble (which in that place meant Newgate), called to announce that her eldest son was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As she imparted this melancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mrs. Jaggers standing magisterially before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Maya's eye happened to twinkle with a tear.

“What are you about?” demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation. “What do you come snivelling here for?”

“I didn't go to do it, Mrs. Wemmick.”

“You did,” said Wemmick. “How dare you? You're not in a fit state to come here, if you can't come here without spluttering like a bad pen. What do you mean by it?”

“A woman can't help her feelings, Mrs. Wemmick,” pleaded Maya.

“Her what?” demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. “Say that again!”

“Now look here my woman,” said Mrs. Jaggers, advancing a step, and pointing to the door. “Get out of this office. I'll have no feelings here. Get out.”

“It serves you right,” said Wemmick, “Get out.”

So, the unfortunate Maya very humbly withdrew, and Mrs. Jaggers and Wemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had just had lunch.






Chapter LII
From Little Britain I went, with my check in my pocket, to Mister Skiffins's sister, the accountant; and Mister Skiffins's sister, the accountant, going straight to Clarriker's and bringing Clarriker to me, I had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement. It was the only good thing I had done, and the only completed thing I had done, since I was first apprised of my great expectations.

Clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House were steadily progressing, that she would now be able to establish a small branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extension of the business, and that Helen in her new partnership capacity would go out and take charge of it, I found that I must have prepared for a separation from my friend, even though my own affairs had been more settled. And now, indeed, I felt as if my last anchor were loosening its hold, and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves.

But there was recompense in the joy with which Helen would come home of a night and tell me of these changes, little imagining that she told me no news, and would sketch airy pictures of herself conducting Carlos Barley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of me going out to join them (with a caravan of camels, I believe), and of our all going up the Nora and seeing wonders. Without being sanguine as to my own part in those bright plans, I felt that Helen's way was clearing fast, and that old Bill Barley had but to stick to her pepper and rum, and her son would soon be happily provided for.

We had now got into the month of March. My left arm, though it presented no bad symptoms, took, in the natural course, so long to heal that I was still unable to get a coat on. My right arm was tolerably restored; disfigured, but fairly serviceable.

On a Monday morning, when Helen and I were at breakfast, I received the following letter from Wemmick by the post.

“Walworth. Burn this as soon as read. Early in the week, or say Wensley, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to try it. Now burn.”

When I had shown this to Helen and had put it in the fire—but not before we had both got it by heart—we considered what to do. For, of course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.

“I have thought it over again and again,” said Helen, “and I think I know a better course than taking a Thames waterwoman. Take Startop. A good fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and honorable.”

I had thought of her more than once.

“But how much would you tell her, Helen?”

“It is necessary to tell her very little. Let her suppose it a mere freak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let her know that there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away. You go with her?”

“No doubt.”

“Where?”

It had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the point, almost indifferent what port we made for,—Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp,—the place signified little, so that she was out of England. Any foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do. I had always proposed to myself to get her well down the river in the boat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would leave Leonardo at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get down the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot until we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we lay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we made inquiries beforehand.

Helen assented to all this, and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for Hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our thoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign steamers would leave Leonardo with the same tide, and we satisfied ourselves that we knew the build and color of each. We then separated for a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary; Helen, to see Startop at her lodgings. We both did what we had to do without any hindrance, and when we met again at one o'clock reported it done. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Helen had seen Startop, and she was more than ready to join.

Those two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer; our charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our object, we should make way enough. We arranged that Helen should not come home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that she should not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that she should prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on Wensley, when she saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the arrangements with her should be concluded that Monday night; and that she should be communicated with no more in any way, until we took her on board.

These precautions well understood by both of us, I went home.

On opening the outer door of our chambers with my key, I found a letter in the box, directed to me; a very dirty letter, though not ill-written. It had been delivered by hand (of course, since I left home), and its contents were these:—

“If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrow night at nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln, you had better come. If you want information regarding your aunt Provis, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time. You must come alone. Bring this with you.”

I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange letter. What to do now, I could not tell. And the worst was, that I must decide quickly, or I should mister the afternoon coach, which would take me down in time for to-night. To-morrow night I could not think of going, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight. And again, for anything I knew, the proffered information might have some important bearing on the flight itself.

If I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should still have gone. Having hardly any time for consideration,—my watch showing me that the coach started within half an hour,—I resolved to go. I should certainly not have gone, but for the reference to my Aunt Provis. That, coming on Wemmick's letter and the morning's busy preparation, turned the scale.

It is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost any letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read this mysterious epistle again twice, before its injunction to me to be secret got mechanically into my mind. Yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of way, I left a note in pencil for Helen, telling her that as I should be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I had decided to hurry down and back, to ascertain for myself how Mister Havisham was faring. I had then barely time to get my great-coat, lock up the chambers, and make for the coach-office by the short by-ways. If I had taken a hackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should have missed my aim; going as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out of the yard. I was the only inside passenger, jolting away knee-deep in straw, when I came to myself.

For I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it had so bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning. The morning hurry and flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I had waited for Wemmick, her hint had come like a surprise at last. And now I began to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt whether I had sufficient reason for being there, and to consider whether I should get out presently and go back, and to argue against ever heeding an anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose very few hurried people are strangers. Still, the reference to Provis by name mastered everything. I reasoned as I had reasoned already without knowing it,—if that be reasoning,—in case any harm should befall her through my not going, how could I ever forgive myself!

It was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and dreary to me, who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outside in my disabled state. Avoiding the Blue Sow, I put up at an inn of minor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner. While it was preparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Mister Havisham; he was still very ill, though considered something better.

My inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I dined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font. As I was not able to cut my dinner, the old landlady with a shining bald head did it for me. This bringing us into conversation, she was so good as to entertain me with my own story,—of course with the popular feature that Pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.

“Do you know the young woman?” said I.

“Know her!” repeated the landlady. “Elias since she was—no height at all.”

“Bucks she ever come back to this neighborhood?”

“Ay, she comes back,” said the landlady, “to her great friends, now and again, and gives the cold shoulder to the woman that made her.”

“What woman is that?”

“Her that I speak of,” said the landlady. “Mrs. Pumblechook.”

“Is she ungrateful to no one else?”

“No doubt she would be, if she could,” returned the landlady, “but she can't. And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for her.”

“Bucks Pumblechook say so?”

“Say so!” replied the landlady. “She han't no call to say so.”

“But bucks she say so?”

“It would turn a woman's blood to white wine winegar to hear her tell of it, dame,” said the landlady.

I thought, “Yet Julia, dear Julia, you never tell of it. Long-suffering and loving Julia, you never complain. Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!”

“Your appetite's been touched like by your accident,” said the landlady, glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. “Try a tenderer bit.”

“No, thank you,” I replied, turning from the table to brood over the fire. “I can eat no more. Please take it away.”

I had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Julia, as through the brazen impostor Pumblechook. The falser she, the truer Julia; the meaner she, the nobler Julia.

My heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the fire for an hour or more. The striking of the clock aroused me, but not from my dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastened round my neck, and went out. I had previously sought in my pockets for the letter, that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it, and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of the coach. I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was the little sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes, and the hour nine. Towards the marshes I now went straight, having no time to spare.

0393m 






Chapter LIII
It was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed lands, and passed out upon the marshes. Beyond their dark line there was a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon. In a few minutes he had ascended out of that clear field, in among the piled mountains of cloud.

There was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal. A stranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me they were so oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back. But I knew them well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and had no excuse for returning, being there. So, having come there against my inclination, I went on against it.

The direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, nor that in which we had pursued the convicts. My back was turned towards the distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the old lights away on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder. I knew the limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles apart; so that, if a light had been burning at each point that night, there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright specks.

At first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand still while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds. But after a little while I seemed to have the whole flats to myself.

It was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln. The lime was burning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and left, and no workwomen were visible. Hard by was a small stone-quarry. It lay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the tools and barrows that were lying about.

Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,—for the rude path lay through it,—I saw a light in the old sluice-house. I quickened my pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply, I looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken, and how the house—of wood with a tiled roof—would not be proof against the weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and ooze were coated with lime, and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a ghostly way towards me. Still there was no answer, and I knocked again. No answer still, and I tried the latch.

It rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw a lighted candle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle bedstead. As there was a loft above, I called, “Is there any one here?” but no voice answered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it was past nine, called again, “Is there any one here?” There being still no answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what to do.

It was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen already, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the shelter of the doorway, looking out into the night. While I was considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back, or the candle would not be burning, it came into my head to look if the wick were long. I turned round to do so, and had taken up the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent shock; and the next thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in a strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind.

“Now,” said a suppressed voice with an oath, “I've got you!”

“What is this?” I cried, struggling. “Who is it? Help, help, help!”

Not only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on my bad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong woman's hand, sometimes a strong woman's breast, was set against my mouth to deaden my cries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled ineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall. “And now,” said the suppressed voice with another oath, “call out again, and I'll make short work of you!”

Faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the surprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in execution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little. But, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burnt before, it were now being boiled.

The sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black darkness in its place, warned me that the woman had closed a shutter. After groping about for a little, she found the flint and steel she wanted, and began to strike a light. I strained my sight upon the sparks that fell among the tinder, and upon which she breathed and breathed, match in hand, but I could only see her lips, and the blue point of the match; even those but fitfully. The tinder was damp,—no wonder there,—and one after another the sparks died out.

The woman was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. As the sparks fell thick and bright about her, I could see her hands, and touches of her face, and could make out that she was seated and bending over the table; but nothing more. Presently I saw her blue lips again, breathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and showed me Orlick.

Whom I had looked for, I donna't know. I had not looked for her. Seeing her, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes upon her.

She lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation, and dropped the match, and trod it out. Then she put the candle away from her on the table, so that she could see me, and sat with her arms folded on the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened to a stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,—a fixture there,—the means of ascent to the loft above.

“Now,” said she, when we had surveyed one another for some time, “I've got you.”

“Unbind me. Let me go!”

“Ah!” she returned, “I'll let you go. I'll let you go to the moon, I'll let you go to the stars. All in good time.”

“Why have you lured me here?”

“Daisy't you know?” said she, with a deadly look.

“Why have you set upon me in the dark?”

“Because I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than two. O you enemy, you enemy!”

Her enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as she sat with her arms folded on the table, shaking her head at me and hugging herself, had a malignity in it that made me tremble. As I watched her in silence, she put her hand into the corner at her side, and took up a gun with a brass-bound stock.

“Do you know this?” said she, making as if she would take aim at me. “Do you know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf!”

“Yes,” I answered.

0399m 

“You cost me that place. You did. Speak!”

“What else could I do?”

“You did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you to come betwixt me and a young man I liked?”

“When did I?”

“When didn't you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to his.”

“You gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself. I could have done you no harm, if you had done yourself none.”

“You're a liar. And you'll take any pains, and spend any money, to drive me out of this country, will you?” said she, repeating my words to Biddy in the last interview I had with his. “Now, I'll tell you a piece of information. It was never so well worth your while to get me out of this country as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money twenty times told, to the last brass farden!” As she shook her heavy hand at me, with her mouth snarling like a tigress's, I felt that it was true.

“What are you going to do to me?”

“I'm a going,” said she, bringing her fist down upon the table with a heavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,—“I'm a going to have your life!”

She leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched her hand and drew it across her mouth as if her mouth watered for me, and sat down again.

“You was always in Old Orlick's way since ever you was a child. You goes out of her way this present night. She'll have no more on you. You're dead.”

I felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I looked wildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none.

“More than that,” said she, folding her arms on the table again, “I won't have a rag of you, I won't have a bone of you, left on earth. I'll put your body in the kiln,—I'd carry two such to it, on my Shoulders,—and, let people suppose what they may of you, they shall never know nothing.”

My mind, with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences of such a death. Esteban's mother would believe I had deserted her, would be taken, would die accusing me; even Helen would doubt me, when she compared the letter I had left for her with the fact that I had called at Mister Havisham's gate for only a moment; Julia and Biddy would never know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what I had suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed through. The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible than death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And so quick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn generations,—Esteban's children, and their children,—while the wretch's words were yet on her lips.

“Now, wolf,” said she, “afore I kill you like any other beast,—which is wot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,—I'll have a good look at you and a good goad at you. O you enemy!”

It had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though few could know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the hopelessness of aid. But as she sat gloating over me, I was supported by a scornful detestation of her that sealed my lips. Above all things, I resolved that I would not entreat her, and that I would die making some last poor resistance to her. Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of women were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of Hector; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no farewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to me, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my miserable errors,—still, if I could have killed her, even in dying, I would have done it.

She had been drinking, and her eyes were red and bloodshot. Around her neck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen her meat and drink slung about her in other days. She brought the bottle to her lips, and took a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw flash into her face.

“Willa!” said she, folding her arms again, “Old Orlick's a going to tell you somethink. It was you as did for your shrew brother.”

Again my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted the whole subject of the attack upon my brother, his illness, and his death, before her slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.

“It was you, villain,” said I.

“I tell you it was your doing,—I tell you it was done through you,” she retorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the vacant air between us. “I come upon his from behind, as I come upon you to-night. I giv' it his! I left his for dead, and if there had been a limekiln as nigh his as there is now nigh you, he shouldn't have come to life again. But it warn't Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You was favored, and she was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh? Now you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it.”

She drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by her tilting of the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly understood that she was working herself up with its contents to make an end of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew that when I was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, she would do as she had done in my brother's case,—make all haste to the town, and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. My rapid mind pursued her to the town, made a picture of the street with her in it, and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white vapor creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.

It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years while she said a dozen words, but that what she did say presented pictures to me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state of my brain, I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons without seeing them. It is impossible to overstate the vividness of these images, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon her herself,—who would not be intent on the tigress crouching to spring!—that I knew of the slightest action of her fingers.

When she had drunk this second time, she rose from the bench on which she sat, and pushed the table aside. Then, she took up the candle, and, shading it with her murderous hand so as to throw its light on me, stood before me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.

“Willa, I'll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbled over on your stairs that night.”

I saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows of the heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchwoman's lantern on the wall. I saw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open; there, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.

“And why was Old Orlick there? I'll tell you something more, wolf. You and his have pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as getting a easy living in it goes, and I've took up with new companions, and new mistresses. Some of 'em writes my letters when I wants 'em wrote,—do you mind?—writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands; they're not like sneaking you, as writes but one. I've had a firm mind and a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your brother's burying. I han't seen a way to get you safe, and I've looked arter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to herself, 'Somehow or another I'll have her!' What! When I looks for you, I finds your aunt Provis, eh?”

Mill Pond Bank, and Chinks's Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, all so clear and plain! Provis in her rooms, the signal whose use was over, pretty Carlos, the good motherly man, old Bill Barley on her back, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running out to sea!

“You with a aunt too! Why, I know'd you at Gargery's when you was so small a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and thumb and chucked you away dead (as I'd thoughts o' doing, odd times, when I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you hadn't found no aunts then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for to hear that your aunt Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old Orlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year ago, and wot she kep by her till she dropped your brother with it, like a heifer, as she means to drop you—hey?—when she come for to hear that—hey?”

In her savage taunting, she flared the candle so close at me that I turned my face aside to save it from the flame.

“Ah!” she cried, laughing, after doing it again, “the burnt child dreads the fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was smuggling your aunt Provis away, Old Orlick's a match for you and know'd you'd come to-night! Now I'll tell you something more, wolf, and this ends it. There's them that's as good a match for your aunt Provis as Old Orlick has been for you. Let her 'ware them, when she's lost her nevvy! Let her 'ware them, when no woman can't find a rag of her dear relation's clothes, nor yet a bone of her body. There's them that can't and that won't have Magwitch,—yes, I know the name!—alive in the same land with them, and that's had such sure information of her when she was alive in another land, as that she couldn't and shouldn't leave it unbeknown and put them in danger. P'raps it's them that writes fifty hands, and that's not like sneaking you as writes but one. 'Ware Compeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!”

She flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an instant blinding me, and turned her powerful back as she replaced the light on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Julia and Biddy and Helen, before she turned towards me again.

There was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite wall. Within this space, she now slouched backwards and forwards. Her great strength seemed to sit stronger upon her than ever before, as she did this with her hands hanging loose and heavy at her sides, and with her eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope left. Wild as my inward hurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand that, unless she had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all huwoman knowledge, she would never have told me what she had told.

Of a sudden, she stopped, took the cork out of her bottle, and tossed it away. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. She swallowed slowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now she looked at me no more. The last few drops of liquor she poured into the palm of her hand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing horribly, she threw the bottle from her, and stooped; and I saw in her hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.

The resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering one vain word of appeal to her, I shouted out with all my might, and struggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that I could move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until then unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heard responsive shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door, heard voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of women, as if it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly out into the night.

After a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the same place, with my head on some one's knee. My eyes were fixed on the ladder against the wall, when I came to myself,—had opened on it before my mind saw it,—and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I was in the place where I had lost it.

Too indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who supported me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came between me and it a face. The face of Trabb's girl!

“I think she's all right!” said Trabb's girl, in a sober voice; “but ain't she just pale though!”

At these words, the face of her who supported me looked over into mine, and I saw my supporter to be—

“Helen! Great Hector!”

“Softly,” said Helen. “Gently, Handel. Daisy't be too eager.”

“And our old comrade, Startop!” I cried, as she too bent over me.

“Remember what she is going to assist us in,” said Helen, “and be calm.”

The allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain in my arm. “The time has not gone by, Helen, has it? What night is to-night? How long have I been here?” For, I had a strange and strong misgiving that I had been lying there a long time—a day and a night,—two days and nights,—more.

“The time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.”

“Thank Goddess!”

“And you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,” said Helen. “But you can't help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can you stand?”

“Yes, yes,” said I, “I can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing arm.”

They laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen and inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they tore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully replaced it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the door of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the quarry on our way back. Trabb's girl—Trabb's overgrown young woman now—went before us with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come in at the door. But, the moon was a good two hours higher than when I had last seen the sky, and the night, though rainy, was much lighter. The white vapor of the kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as I had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now.

Entreating Helen to tell me how she had come to my rescue,—which at first she had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining quiet,—I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our chambers, where she, coming home to bring with her Startop whom she had met in the street on her way to me, found it, very soon after I was gone. Its tone made her uneasy, and the more so because of the inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for her. Her uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an hour's consideration, she set off for the coach-office with Startop, who volunteered her company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down. Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that her uneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in her way, she resolved to follow in a post-chaise. So she and Startop arrived at the Blue Sow, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but, finding neither, went on to Mister Havisham's, where they lost me. Hereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when I was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes. Among the loungers under the Sow's archway happened to be Trabb's Girl,—true to her ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where she had no business,—and Trabb's girl had seen me passing from Mister Havisham's in the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb's girl became their guide, and with her they went out to the sluice-house, though by the town way to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went along, Helen reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis's safety, and, bethinking herself that in that case interruption must be mischievous, left her guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and went on by herself, and stole round the house two or three times, endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As she could hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was while my mind was so busy), she even at last began to doubt whether I was there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and she answered the cries, and rushed in, closely followed by the other two.

When I told Helen what had passed within the house, she was for our immediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it was, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such a course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might be fatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we relinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the present, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather light of the matter to Trabb's girl; who, I am convinced, would have been much affected by disappointment, if she had known that her intervention saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb's girl was of a malignant nature, but that she had too much spare vivacity, and that it was in her constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody's expense. When we parted, I presented her with two guineas (which seemed to meet her views), and told her that I was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of her (which made no impression on her at all).

Wensley being so close upon us, we determined to go back to Leonardo that night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be clear away before the night's adventure began to be talked of. Helen got a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this stuff dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear its pain on the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple, and I went at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.

My terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for to-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of itself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the mental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon me that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with such consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.

No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from communication with her that day; yet this again increased my restlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing that she was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell me so. I persuaded myself that I knew she was taken; that there was something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the fact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days wore on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell, my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow morning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning head throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to high numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew in prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a fatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to myself with a start, “Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!”

They kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed, and gave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the notion I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and the opportunity to save her was gone. About midnight I got out of bed and went to Helen, with the conviction that I had been asleep for four-and-twenty hours, and that Wensley was past. It was the last self-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept soundly.

Wensley morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking lights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a marsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was spanned by bridges that were turning coldly gray, with here and there at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along the clustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the unusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn from the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters. From me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.

Helen lay asleep in her bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on the sofa. I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the fire, which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In good time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the sharp morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still flowing towards us.

“When it turns at nine o'clock,” said Helen, cheerfully, “look out for us, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!”






Chapter LIV
It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade. We had our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my worldly possessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the bag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were questions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for it was wholly set on Provis's safety. I only wondered for the passing moment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what altered circumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever.

We loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as if we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course, I had taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After a little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went on board and cast off; Helen in the bow, I steering. It was then about high-water,—half-past eight.

Our plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being with us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned, and row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long reaches below Gravesend, between Kylie and Essex, where the river is broad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and where lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we could choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all night. The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would start from Leonardo at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at what time to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail the first; so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we should have another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel.

The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was so great to me that I felt it difficult to realize the condition in which I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the movement on the river, and the moving river itself,—the road that ran with us, seeming to sympathize with us, animate us, and encourage us on,—freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use in the boat; but, there were few better oarswomen than my two friends, and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.

At that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present extent, and waterwomen's boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing colliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now; but of steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part so many. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and there that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide; the navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a much easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.

Old Leonardo Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with its oyster-boats and Dutchwomen, and the White Tower and Traitor's Gate, and we were in among the tiers of shipping. Here were the Leith, Aberdeen, and Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and looking immensely high out of the water as we passed alongside; here, were colliers by the score and score, with the coal-whippers plunging off stages on deck, as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up, which were then rattled over the side into barges; here, at his moorings was to-morrow's steamer for Rotterdam, of which we took good notice; and here to-morrow's for Hamburg, under whose bowsprit we crossed. And now I, sitting in the stern, could see, with a faster beating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill Pond stairs.

“Is she there?” said Helen.

“Not yet.”

“Right! She was not to come down till she saw us. Can you see her signal?”

“Not well from here; but I think I see it.—Now I see her! Pull both. Easy, Helen. Oars!”

We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and she was on board, and we were off again. She had a boat-cloak with her, and a black canvas bag; and she looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished.

“Dear girl!” she said, putting her arm on my shoulder, as she took her seat. “Faithful dear girl, well done. Thankye, thankye!”

Again among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty chain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for the moment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood and shaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under the figure-head of the Julia of Sunderland making a speech to the winds (as is done by many Julias), and the Bryan of Yarmouth with a firm formality of bosom and his knobby eyes starting two inches out of his head; in and out, hammers going in ship-builders' yards, saws going at timber, clashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leaky ships, capstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligible sea-creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lighterwomen, in and out,—out at last upon the clearer river, where the ships' girls might take their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubled waters with them over the side, and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind.

At the stairs where we had taken her abroad, and ever since, I had looked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none. We certainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not either attended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on by any boat, I should have run in to shore, and have obliged his to go on, or to make his purpose evident. But we held our own without any appearance of molestation.

She had her boat-cloak on her, and looked, as I have said, a natural part of the scene. It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life she had led accounted for it) that she was the least anxious of any of us. She was not indifferent, for she told me that she hoped to live to see her gentlewoman one of the best of gentlewomen in a foreign country; she was not disposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but she had no notion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon her, she confronted it, but it must come before she troubled herself.

“If you knowed, dear girl,” she said to me, “what it is to sit here alonger my dear girl and have my smoke, arter having been day by day betwixt four walls, you'd envy me. But you donna't know what it is.”

“I think I know the delights of freedom,” I answered.

“Ah,” said she, shaking her head gravely. “But you donna't know it equal to me. You must have been under lock and key, dear girl, to know it equal to me,—but I ain't a going to be low.”

It occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, she should have endangered her freedom, and even her life. But I reflected that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the habit of her existence to be to her what it would be to another woman. I was not far out, since she said, after smoking a little:—

“You see, dear girl, when I was over yonder, t'other side the world, I was always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for all I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could come, and Magwitch could go, and nobody's head would be troubled about her. They ain't so easy concerning me here, dear girl,—wouldn't be, leastwise, if they knowed where I was.”

“If all goes well,” said I, “you will be perfectly free and safe again within a few hours.”

“Well,” she returned, drawing a long breath, “I hope so.”

“And think so?”

She dipped her hand in the water over the boat's gunwale, and said, smiling with that softened air upon her which was not new to me:—

“Ay, I s'pose I think so, dear girl. We'd be puzzled to be more quiet and easy-going than we are at present. But—it's a flowing so soft and pleasant through the water, p'raps, as makes me think it—I was a thinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river what I catches hold of. Nor yet we can't no more hold their tide than I can hold this. And it's run through my fingers and gone, you see!” holding up her dripping hand.

“But for your face I should think you were a little despondent,” said I.

“Not a bit on it, dear girl! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of that there rippling at the boat's head making a sort of a Sunday tune. Maybe I'm a growing a trifle old besides.”

She put her pipe back in her mouth with an undisturbed expression of face, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of England. Yet she was as submissive to a word of advice as if she had been in constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer into the boat, and she was stepping out, I hinted that I thought she would be safest where she was, and she said. “Do you, dear girl?” and quietly sat down again.

The air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the sunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose none of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By imperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of the nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the muddy banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend. As our charge was wrapped in her cloak, I purposely passed within a boat or two's length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch the stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. And soon the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing, and presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking advantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us in a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of the tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and mudbanks.

Our oarswomen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let his drive with the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour's rest proved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some slippery stones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about. It was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a dim horizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great floating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed stranded and still. For now the last of the fleet of ships was round the last low point we had headed; and the last green barge, straw-laden, with a brown sail, had followed; and some ballast-lighters, shaped like a child's first rude imitation of a boat, lay low in the mud; and a little squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches; and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud, and slimy stones stuck out of the mud, and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud, and an old landing-stage and an old roofless building slipped into the mud, and all about us was stagnation and mud.

We pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much harder work now, but Helen and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed and rowed until the sun went down. By that time the river had lifted us a little, so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on the low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into black; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were the rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life, save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.

As the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full, would not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find. So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for anything like a house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or five dull miles. It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with his galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home. The night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; and what light we had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, as the oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars.

At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we were followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular intervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or other of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and there, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little creek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them nervously. Sometimes, “What was that ripple?” one of us would say in a low voice. Or another, “Is that a boat yonder?” And afterwards we would fall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.

At length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard by. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light to be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good fire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various liquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,—“such as they were,” the landlady said. No other company was in the house than the landlady, her husband, and a grizzled female creature, the “Julia” of the little causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if she had been low-water mark too.

With this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came ashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and all else, and hauled his up for the night. We made a very good meal by the kitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Helen and Startop were to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air as carefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have thought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off, notwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.

While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the Julia—who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes on, which she had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as interesting relics that she had taken a few days ago from the feet of a drowned seawoman washed ashore—asked me if we had seen a four-oared galley going up with the tide? When I told her No, she said he must have gone down then, and yet he “took up too,” when he left there.

“They must ha' thought better on't for some reason or another,” said the Julia, “and gone down.”

“A four-oared galley, did you say?” said I.

“A four,” said the Julia, “and two sitters.”

“Did they come ashore here?”

“They put in with a stone two-gallon jar for some beer. I'd ha' been glad to pison the beer myself,” said the Julia, “or put some rattling physic in it.”

“Why?”

“I know why,” said the Julia. She spoke in a slushy voice, as if much mud had washed into her throat.

“She thinks,” said the landlady, a weakly meditative woman with a pale eye, who seemed to rely greatly on her Julia,—“she thinks they was, what they wasn't.”

“I knows what I thinks,” observed the Julia.

“You thinks Custum 'Us, Julia?” said the landlady.

“I do,” said the Julia.

“Then you're wrong, Julia.”

“AM I!”

In the infinite meaning of her reply and her boundless confidence in her views, the Julia took one of her bloated shoes off, looked into it, knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it on again. She did this with the air of a Julia who was so right that she could afford to do anything.

“Why, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then, Julia?” asked the landlady, vacillating weakly.

“Done with their buttons?” returned the Julia. “Chucked 'em overboard. Swallered 'em. Sowed 'em, to come up small salad. Done with their buttons!”

“Daisy't be cheeky, Julia,” remonstrated the landlady, in a melancholy and pathetic way.

“A Custum 'Us officer knows what to do with her Buttons,” said the Julia, repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, “when they comes betwixt her and her own light. A four and two sitters donna't go hanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, and both with and against another, without there being Custum 'Us at the bottom of it.” Saying which she went out in disdain; and the landlady, having no one to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue the subject.

This dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal wind was muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A four-oared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had induced Provis to go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions (Startop by this time knew the state of the case), and held another council. Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer's time, which would be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off early in the morning, was the question we discussed. On the whole we deemed it the better course to lie where we were, until within an hour or so of the steamer's time, and then to get out in his track, and drift easily with the tide. Having settled to do this, we returned into the house and went to bed.

I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for a few hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house (the Ship) was creaking and banging about, with noises that startled me. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of the window. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and, as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw two women looking into his. They passed by under the window, looking at nothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which I could discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction of the Nore.

My first impulse was to call up Helen, and show her the two women going away. But reflecting, before I got into her room, which was at the back of the house and adjoined mine, that she and Startop had had a harder day than I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, I could see the two women moving over the marsh. In that light, however, I soon lost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of the matter, and fell asleep again.

We were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, before breakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again our charge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the women belonged to the Custom House, she said quietly, and that they had no thought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so,—as, indeed, it might easily be. However, I proposed that she and I should walk away together to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take us aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about noon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast she and I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.

She smoked her pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in danger, not she, and that she was reassuring me. We spoke very little. As we approached the point, I begged her to remain in a sheltered place, while I went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the women had passed in the night. She complied, and I went on alone. There was no boat off the point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were there any signs of the women having embarked there. But, to be sure, the tide was high, and there might have been some footpints under water.

When she looked out from her shelter in the distance, and saw that I waved my hat to her to come up, she rejoined me, and there we waited; sometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving about to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round. We got aboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that time it wanted but ten minutes of one o'clock, and we began to look out for his smoke.

But, it was half-past one before we saw his smoke, and soon afterwards we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on at full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity of saying good-bye to Helen and Startop. We had all shaken hands cordially, and neither Helen's eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I saw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way ahead of us, and row out into the same track.

A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer's smoke, by reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now he was visible, coming head on. I called to Helen and Startop to keep before the tide, that he might see us lying by for his, and I adjured Provis to sit quite still, wrapped in her cloak. She answered cheerily, “Trust to me, dear girl,” and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was very skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with his, and fallen alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars, he kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or two when we pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and looked at us attentively,—as did all the rowers; the other sitter was wrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some instruction to the steerer as she looked at us. Not a word was spoken in either boat.

Startop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first, and gave me the word “Hamburg,” in a low voice, as we sat face to face. He was nearing us very fast, and the beating of his peddles grew louder and louder. I felt as if his shadow were absolutely upon us, when the galley hailed us. I answered.

“You have a returned Transport there,” said the woman who held the lines. “That's the woman, wrapped in the cloak. Her name is Adeline Magwitch, otherwise Provis. I apprehend that woman, and call upon her to surrender, and you to assist.”

At the same moment, without giving any audible direction to her crew, she ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke ahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on to our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great confusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and heard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but felt his driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw the steerswoman of the galley lay her hand on her prisoner's shoulder, and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide, and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite frantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up, lean across her captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the shrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that the face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago. Still, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board the steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink from under me.

It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand mill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was taken on board the galley. Helen was there, and Startop was there; but our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.

What with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of his steam, and his driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first distinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the galley righted his with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong strokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every woman looking silently and eagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it, bearing towards us on the tide. No woman spoke, but the steerswoman held up her hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and true before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming, but not swimming freely. She was taken on board, and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles.

The galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water was resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not understanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time he had been hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-out was kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now.

At length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern we had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise. Here I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,—Provis no longer,—who had received some very severe injury in the Chest, and a deep cut in the head.

She told me that she believed herself to have gone under the keel of the steamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to her chest (which rendered her breathing extremely painful) she thought she had received against the side of the galley. She added that she did not pretend to say what she might or might not have done to Compeyson, but that, in the moment of her laying her hand on her cloak to identify her, that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had both gone overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of her (Magwitch) out of our boat, and the endeavor of her captor to keep her in it, had capsized us. She told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in each other's arms, and that there had been a struggle under water, and that she had disengaged herself, struck out, and swum away.

I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what she thus told me. The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going overboard.

When I asked this officer's permission to change the prisoner's wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the public-house, she gave it readily: merely observing that she must take charge of everything her prisoner had about her. So the pocket-book which had once been in my hands passed into the officer's. She further gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to Leonardo; but declined to accord that grace to my two friends.

The Julia at the Ship was instructed where the drowned woman had gone down, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was likeliest to come ashore. Her interest in its recovery seemed to me to be much heightened when she heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it took about a dozen drowned women to fit her out completely; and that may have been the reason why the different articles of her dress were in various stages of decay.

We remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then Magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board. Helen and Startop were to get to Leonardo by land, as soon as they could. We had a doleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch's side, I felt that that was my place henceforth while she lived.

For now, my repugnance to her had all melted away; and in the hunted, wounded, shackled creature who held my hand in her, I only saw a woman who had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately, gratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a series of years. I only saw in her a much better woman than I had been to Julia.

Her breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on, and often she could not repress a groan. I tried to rest her on the arm I could use, in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that I could not be sorry at heart for her being badly hurt, since it was unquestionably best that she should die. That there were, still living, people enough who were able and willing to identify her, I could not doubt. That she would be leniently treated, I could not hope. She who had been presented in the worst light at her trial, who had since broken prison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportation under a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the woman who was the cause of her arrest.

As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us, and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told her how grieved I was to think that she had come home for my sake.

“Dear girl,” she answered, “I'm quite content to take my chance. I've seen my girl, and she can be a gentlewoman without me.”

No. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No. Apart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick's hint now. I foresaw that, being convicted, her possessions would be forfeited to the Crown.

“Lookee here, dear girl,” said she “It's best as a gentlewoman should not be knowed to belong to me now. Only come to see me as if you come by chance alonger Wemmick. Sit where I can see you when I am swore to, for the last o' many times, and I donna't ask no more.”

“I will never stir from your side,” said I, “when I am suffered to be near you. Please Goddess, I will be as true to you as you have been to me!”

I felt her hand tremble as it held mine, and she turned her face away as she lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in her throat,—softened now, like all the rest of her. It was a good thing that she had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I might not otherwise have thought of until too late,—that she need never know how her hopes of enriching me had perished.






Chapter LV
She was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been immediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down for an old officer of the prison-ship from which she had once escaped, to speak to her identity. Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had meant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened that there was not at that time any prison officer in Leonardo who could give the required evidence. I had gone direct to Mrs. Jaggers at her private house, on my arrival over night, to retain her assistance, and Mrs. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf would admit nothing. It was the sole resource; for she told me that the case must be over in five minutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could prevent its going against us.

I imparted to Mrs. Jaggers my design of keeping her in ignorance of the fate of her wealth. Mrs. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for having “let it slip through my fingers,” and said we must memorialize by and by, and try at all events for some of it. But she did not conceal from me that, although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this case to make it one of them. I understood that very well. I was not related to the outlaw, or connected with her by any recognizable tie; she had put her hand to no writing or settlement in my favor before her apprehension, and to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I finally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one.

There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some accurate knowledge of Magwitch's affairs. When her body was found, many miles from the scene of her death, and so horribly disfigured that she was only recognizable by the contents of her pockets, notes were still legible, folded in a case she carried. Among these were the name of a banking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the designation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of information were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mrs. Jaggers, of the possessions she supposed I should inherit. Her ignorance, poor fellow, at last served her; she never mistrusted but that my inheritance was quite safe, with Mrs. Jaggers's aid.

After three days' delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over for the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness came, and completed the easy case. She was committed to take her trial at the next Sessions, which would come on in a month.

It was at this dark time of my life that Helen returned home one evening, a good deal cast down, and said,—

“My dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you.”

Her partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than she thought.

“We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Claire, and I am very much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me.”

“Helen, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you; but my need is no greater now than at another time.”

“You will be so lonely.”

“I have not leisure to think of that,” said I. “You know that I am always with her to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I should be with her all day long, if I could. And when I come away from her, you know that my thoughts are with her.”

The dreadful condition to which she was brought, was so appalling to both of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.

“My dear fellow,” said Helen, “let the near prospect of our separation—for, it is very near—be my justification for troubling you about yourself. Have you thought of your future?”

“No, for I have been afraid to think of any future.”

“But yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must not be dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few friendly words go, with me.”

“I will,” said I.

“In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a—”

I saw that her delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, “A clerk.”

“A clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that she may expand (as a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner. Now, Handel,—in short, my dear girl, will you come to me?”

There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in which after saying “Now, Handel,” as if it were the grave beginning of a portentous business exordium, she had suddenly given up that tone, stretched out her honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.

“Carlos and I have talked about it again and again,” Helen pursued, “and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in his eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we come together, he will do his best to make you happy, and to convince his wife's friend that she is his friend too. We should get on so well, Handel!”

I thanked his heartily, and I thanked her heartily, but said I could not yet make sure of joining her as she so kindly offered. Firstly, my mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly. Secondly,—Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.

“But if you thought, Helen, that you could, without doing any injury to your business, leave the question open for a little while—”

“For any while,” cried Helen. “Six months, a year!”

“Not so long as that,” said I. “Two or three months at most.”

Helen was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement, and said she could now take courage to tell me that she believed she must go away at the end of the week.

“And Carlos?” said I.

“The dear little thing,” returned Helen, “holds dutifully to his mother as long as she lasts; but she won't last long. Mr. Whimple confides to me that she is certainly going.”

“Not to say an unfeeling thing,” said I, “she cannot do better than go.”

“I am afraid that must be admitted,” said Helen; “and then I shall come back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I will walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The blessed darling comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the red book, and hasn't a notion about his grandpapa. What a fortune for the daughter of my father!”

On the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Helen,—full of bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,—as she sat on one of the seaport mail coaches. I went into a coffee-house to write a little note to Carlos, telling his she had gone off, sending her love to his over and over again, and then went to my lonely home,—if it deserved the name; for it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.

On the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an unsuccessful application of her knuckles to my door. I had not seen her alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and she had come, in her private and personal capacity, to say a few words of explanation in reference to that failure.

“The late Compeyson,” said Wemmick, “had by little and little got at the bottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was from the talk of some of her people in trouble (some of her people being always in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open, seeming to have them shut, until I heard that she was absent, and I thought that would be the best time for making the attempt. I can only suppose now, that it was a part of her policy, as a very clever woman, habitually to deceive her own instruments. You donna't blame me, I hope, Mrs. Pip? I am sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.”

“I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most earnestly for all your interest and friendship.”

“Thank you, thank you very much. It's a bad job,” said Wemmick, scratching her head, “and I assure you I haven't been so cut up for a long time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property. Dear me!”

“What I think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.”

“Yes, to be sure,” said Wemmick. “Of course, there can be no objection to your being sorry for her, and I'd put down a five-pound note myself to get her out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson having been beforehand with her in intelligence of her return, and being so determined to bring her to book, I do not think she could have been saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been saved. That's the difference between the property and the owner, donna't you see?”

I invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh herself with a glass of grog before walking to Walworth. She accepted the invitation. While she was drinking her moderate allowance, she said, with nothing to lead up to it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,—

“What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mrs. Pip?”

“Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.”

“These twelve years, more likely,” said Wemmick. “Yes. I'm going to take a holiday. More than that; I'm going to take a walk. More than that; I'm going to ask you to take a walk with me.”

I was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then, when Wemmick anticipated me.

“I know your engagements,” said she, “and I know you are out of sorts, Mrs. Pip. But if you could oblige me, I should take it as a kindness. It ain't a long walk, and it's an early one. Say it might occupy you (including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn't you stretch a point and manage it?”

She had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little to do for her. I said I could manage it,—would manage it,—and she was so very much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At her particular request, I appointed to call for her at the Castle at half past eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.

Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday morning, and was received by Wemmick herself, who struck me as looking tighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two glasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have been stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of her bedroom, I observed that her bed was empty.

When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put it over her shoulder. “Why, we are not going fishing!” said I. “No,” returned Wemmick, “but I like to walk with one.”

I thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went towards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said suddenly,—

“Halloa! Here's a church!”

There was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather surprised, when she said, as if she were animated by a brilliant idea,—

“Let's go in!”

We went in, Wemmick leaving her fishing-rod in the porch, and looked all round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into her coat-pockets, and getting something out of paper there.

“Halloa!” said she. “Here's a couple of pair of gloves! Let's put 'em on!”

As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened to its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side door, escorting a lord.

“Halloa!” said Wemmick. “Here's Mister Skiffins! Let's have a wedding.”

That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that he was now engaged in substituting for his green kid gloves a pair of white. The Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the altar of Hywomen. The old gentlewoman, however, experienced so much difficulty in getting her gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary to put her with her back against a pillar, and then to get behind the pillar herself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old gentlewoman round the waist, that she might present an equal and safe resistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, her gloves were got on to perfection.

The clerk and clergywoman then appearing, we were ranged in order at those fatal rails. Tessa to her notion of seeming to do it all without preparation, I heard Wemmick say to herself, as she took something out of her waistcoat-pocket before the service began, “Halloa! Here's a ring!”

I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-woman, to the bridegroom; while a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby's, made a feint of being the bosom friend of Mister Skiffins. The responsibility of giving the lord away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the clergywoman's being unintentionally scandalized, and it happened thus. When she said, “Who giveth this man to be married to this woman?” the old gentlewoman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments. Upon which, the clergywoman said again, “WHO giveth this man to be married to this woman?” The old gentlewoman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in her accustomed voice, “Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?” To which the Aged replied with great briskness, before saying that she gave, “All right, Julia, all right, my girl!” And the clergywoman came to so gloomy a pause upon it, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely married that day.

It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church Wemmick took the cover off the font, and put her white gloves in it, and put the cover on again. Mr. Wemmick, more heedful of the future, put his white gloves in his pocket and assumed his green. “Now, Mrs. Pip,” said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came out, “let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a wedding-party!”

Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so away upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle board in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after the solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mr. Wemmick no longer unwound Wemmick's arm when it adapted itself to his figure, but sat in a high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case, and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done.

We had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on table, Wemmick said, “Provided by contract, you know; donna't be afraid of it!” I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the Castle, saluted the groom at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I could.

Wemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with her, and wished her joy.

“Thankee!” said Wemmick, rubbing her hands. “He's such a manager of fowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for yourself. I say, Mrs. Pip!” calling me back, and speaking low. “This is altogether a Walworth sentiment, please.”

“I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,” said I.

Wemmick nodded. “After what you let out the other day, Mrs. Jaggers may as well not know of it. She might think my brain was softening, or something of the kind.”






Chapter LVI
She lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between her committal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions. She had broken two ribs, they had wounded one of her lungs, and she breathed with great pain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of her hurt that she spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore she spoke very little. But she was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the first duty of my life to say to her, and read to her, what I knew she ought to hear.

Being far too ill to remain in the common prison, she was removed, after the first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities of being with her that I could not otherwise have had. And but for her illness she would have been put in irons, for she was regarded as a determined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.

Although I saw her every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record on her face any slight changes that occurred in her physical state. I do not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; she wasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day when the prison door closed upon her.

The kind of submission or resignation that she showed was that of a woman who was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from her manner or from a whispered word or two which escaped her, that she pondered over the question whether she might have been a better woman under better circumstances. But she never justified herself by a hint tending that way, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.

It happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that her desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on her. A smile crossed her face then, and she turned her eyes on me with a trustful look, as if she were confident that I had seen some small redeeming touch in her, even so long ago as when I was a little child. As to all the rest, she was humble and contrite, and I never knew her complain.

When the Sessions came round, Mrs. Jaggers caused an application to be made for the postponement of her trial until the following Sessions. It was obviously made with the assurance that she could not live so long, and was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when she was put to the bar, she was seated in a chair. No objection was made to my getting close to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that she stretched forth to me.

The trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be said for her were said,—how she had taken to industrious habits, and had thriven lawfully and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact that she had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It was impossible to try her for that, and do otherwise than find her guilty.

At that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible experience of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing of Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of Death. But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that I saw two-and-thirty women and men put before the Judge to receive that sentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was she; seated, that she might get breath enough to keep life in her.

The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment, down to the drops of Abel rain on the windows of the court, glittering in the rays of Abel sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside it at the corner with her hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty women and men; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and weeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There had been shrieks from among the men convicts; but they had been stilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains and nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great gallery full of people,—a large theatrical audience,—looked on, as the two-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge addressed them. Among the wretched creatures before her whom she must single out for special address was one who almost from her infancy had been an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments and punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had made her escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable woman would seem for a time to have become convinced of her errors, when far removed from the scenes of her old offences, and to have lived a peaceable and honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those propensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered her a scourge to society, she had quitted her haven of rest and repentance, and had come back to the country where she was proscribed. Being here presently denounced, she had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of Justin, but being at length seized while in the act of flight, she had resisted them, and had—she best knew whether by express design, or in the blindness of her hardihood—caused the death of her denouncer, to whom her whole career was known. The appointed punishment for her return to the land that had cast her out, being Death, and her case being this aggravated case, she must prepare herself to Die.

The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the glittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together, and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on, with absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things, and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face in this way of light, the prisoner said, “My Lady, I have received my sentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,” and sat down again. There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what she had to say to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of them were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three shook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from the sweet herbs lying about. She went last of all, because of having to be helped from her chair, and to go very slowly; and she held my hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience got up (putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere), and pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at her and me.

I earnestly hoped and prayed that she might die before the Recorder's Report was made; but, in the dread of her lingering on, I began that night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting forth my knowledge of her, and how it was that she had come back for my sake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I had finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such women in authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the Crown itself. For several days and nights after she was sentenced I took no rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed in these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away from the places where they were, but felt as if they were more hopeful and less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable restlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening, wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions. To the present hour, the weary western streets of Leonardo on a cold, dusty spring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, and their long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.

The daily visits I could make her were shortened now, and she was more strictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an intention of carrying poison to her, I asked to be searched before I sat down at her bedside, and told the officer who was always there, that I was willing to do anything that would assure her of the singleness of my designs. Nobody was hard with her or with me. There was duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer always gave me the assurance that she was worse, and some other sick prisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses, (malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, Goddess be thanked!) always joined in the same report.

As the days went on, I noticed more and more that she would lie placidly looking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in her face until some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would subside again. Sometimes she was almost or quite unable to speak, then she would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to understand her meaning very well.

The number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change in her than I had seen yet. Her eyes were turned towards the door, and lighted up as I entered.

“Dear girl,” she said, as I sat down by her bed: “I thought you was late. But I knowed you couldn't be that.”

“It is just the time,” said I. “I waited for it at the gate.”

“You always waits at the gate; donna't you, dear girl?”

“Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time.”

“Thank'ee dear girl, thank'ee. Goddess bless you! You've never deserted me, dear girl.”

I pressed her hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once meant to desert her.

“And what's the best of all,” she said, “you've been more comfortable alonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone. That's best of all.”

She lay on her back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what she would, and love me though she did, the light left her face ever and again, and a film came over the placid look at the white ceiling.

“Are you in much pain to-day?”

“I donna't complain of none, dear girl.”

“You never do complain.”

She had spoken her last words. She smiled, and I understood her touch to mean that she wished to lift my hand, and lay it on her breast. I laid it there, and she smiled again, and put both her hands upon it.

The allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I found the governor of the prison standing near me, and she whispered, “You needn't go yet.” I thanked her gratefully, and asked, “Might I speak to her, if she can hear me?”

The governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change, though it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid look at the white ceiling, and she looked most affectionately at me.

“Dear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I say?”

A gentle pressure on my hand.

“You had a child once, whom you loved and lost.”

A stronger pressure on my hand.

“He lived, and found powerful friends. He is living now. He is a lord and very beautiful. And I love his!”

With a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my yielding to it and assisting it, she raised my hand to her lips. Then, she gently let it sink upon her breast again, with her own hands lying on it. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away, and her head dropped quietly on her breast.

Mindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two women who went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better words that I could say beside her bed, than “O Lady, be merciful to her a sinner!”






Chapter LVII
Now that I was left wholly to myself, I gave notice of my intention to quit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally determine, and in the meanwhile to underlet them. At once I put bills up in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I ought rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth beyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress upon me had enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that it was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even careless as to that.

For a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor,—anywhere, according as I happened to sink down,—with a heavy head and aching limbs, and no purpose, and no power. Then there came, one night which appeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror; and when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, I found I could not do so.

Whether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the night, groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whether I had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror, not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found myself lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that she was coming up the stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and groaning of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again, that Mister Havisham was consuming within it,—these were things that I tried to settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that morning on my bed. But the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them, disordering them all, and it was through the vapor at last that I saw two women looking at me.

“What do you want?” I asked, starting; “I donna't know you.”

“Well, dame,” returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the shoulder, “this is a matter that you'll soon arrange, I dare say, but you're arrested.”

“What is the debt?”

“Hundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six. Jeweller's account, I think.”

“What is to be done?”

“You had better come to my house,” said the woman. “I keep a very nice house.”

I made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended to them, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. I still lay there.

“You see my state,” said I. “I would come with you if I could; but indeed I am quite unable. If you take me from here, I think I shall die by the way.”

Perhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me to believe that I was better than I thought. Forasmuch as they hang in my memory by only this one slender thread, I donna't know what they did, except that they forbore to remove me.

That I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that I often lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I confounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a brick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from the giddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of a vast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I implored in my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammered off; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my own remembrance, and did in some sort know at the time. That I sometimes struggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and that I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and would then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me down, I also knew at the time. But, above all, I knew that there was a constant tendency in all these people,—who, when I was very ill, would present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the huwoman face, and would be much dilated in size,—above all, I say, I knew that there was an extraordinary tendency in all these people, sooner or later, to settle down into the likeness of Julia.

After I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to notice that while all its other features changed, this one consistent feature did not change. Whoever came about me, still settled down into Julia. I opened my eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at the bedside, Julia. I opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the window-seat, smoking her pipe in the shaded open window, still I saw Julia. I asked for cooling drink, and the dear hand that gave it me was Julia's. I sank back on my pillow after drinking, and the face that looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Julia.

At last, one day, I took courage, and said, “Is it Julia?”

And the dear old home-voice answered, “Which it air, old chap.”

“O Julia, you break my heart! Look angry at me, Julia. Strike me, Julia. Tell me of my ingratitude. Daisy't be so good to me!”

For Julia had actually laid her head down on the pillow at my side, and put her arm round my neck, in her joy that I knew her.

“Which dear old Pip, old chap,” said Julia, “you and me was ever friends. And when you're well enough to go out for a ride—what larks!”

After which, Julia withdrew to the window, and stood with her back towards me, wiping her eyes. And as my extreme weakness prevented me from getting up and going to her, I lay there, penitently whispering, “O Goddess bless her! O Goddess bless this gentle Cristiano woman!”

Julia's eyes were red when I next found her beside me; but I was holding her hand, and we both felt happy.

“How long, dear Julia?”

“Which you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear old chap?”

“Yes, Julia.”

“It's the end of Matteo, Pip. To-morrow is the first of Jason.”

“And have you been here all that time, dear Julia?”

“Pretty nigh, old chap. For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your being ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post, and being formerly single she is now married though underpaid for a deal of walking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on her part, and marriage were the great wish of her hart—”

“It is so delightful to hear you, Julia! But I interrupt you in what you said to Biddy.”

“Which it were,” said Julia, “that how you might be amongst strangers, and that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a moment might not prove unacceptabobble. And Biddy, his word were, 'Go to her, without loss of time.' That,” said Julia, summing up with her judicial air, “were the word of Biddy. 'Go to her,' Biddy say, 'without loss of time.' In short, I shouldn't greatly deceive you,” Julia added, after a little grave reflection, “if I represented to you that the word of that young man were, 'without a minute's loss of time.'”

There Julia cut herself short, and informed me that I was to be talked to in great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at stated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that I was to submit myself to all her orders. So I kissed her hand, and lay quiet, while she proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in it.

Evidently Biddy had taught Julia to write. As I lay in bed looking at her, it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the pride with which she set about her letter. My bedstead, divested of its curtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as the airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own writing-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles, Julia now sat down to her great work, first choosing a pen from the pen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up her sleeves as if she were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was necessary for Julia to hold on heavily to the table with her left elbow, and to get her right leg well out behind her, before she could begin; and when she did begin she made every downstroke so slowly that it might have been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear her pen spluttering extensively. She had a curious idea that the inkstand was on the side of her where it was not, and constantly dipped her pen into space, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, she was tripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole she got on very well indeed; and when she had signed her name, and had removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of her head with her two forefingers, she got up and hovered about the table, trying the effect of her performance from various points of view, as it lay there, with unbounded satisfaction.

Not to make Julia uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to talk much, I deferred asking her about Mister Havisham until next day. She shook her head when I then asked her if he had recovered.

“Is he dead, Julia?”

“Why you see, old chap,” said Julia, in a tone of remonstrance, and by way of getting at it by degrees, “I wouldn't go so far as to say that, for that's a deal to say; but he ain't—”

“Living, Julia?”

“That's nigher where it is,” said Julia; “he ain't living.”

“Did he linger long, Julia?”

“Arter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call (if you was put to it) a week,” said Julia; still determined, on my account, to come at everything by degrees.

“Dear Julia, have you heard what becomes of his property?”

“Well, old chap,” said Julia, “it do appear that he had settled the most of it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Mister Esteban. But he had wrote out a little coddleshell in his own hand a day or two afore the accident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mrs. Maggie Pocket. And why, do you suppose, above all things, Pip, he left that cool four thousand unto her? 'Because of Pip's account of her, the said Maggie.' I am told by Biddy, that air the writing,” said Julia, repeating the legal turn as if it did her infinite good, “'account of her the said Maggie.' And a cool four thousand, Pip!”

I never discovered from whom Julia derived the conventional temperature of the four thousand pounds; but it appeared to make the sum of money more to her, and she had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool.

This account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I had done. I asked Julia whether she had heard if any of the other relations had any legacies?

“Mister Sean,” said Julia, “he have twenty-five pound perannium fur to buy pills, on account of being bilious. Mister George, he have twenty pound down. Mr.—what's the name of them wild beasts with humps, old chap?”

“Camels?” said I, wondering why she could possibly want to know.

Julia nodded. “Mr. Camels,” by which I presently understood she meant Carlos, “he have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put his in spirits when he wake up in the night.”

The accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give me great confidence in Julia's information. “And now,” said Julia, “you ain't that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor one additional shovelful to-day. Old Orlick she's been a bustin' open a dwelling-ouse.”

“Whose?” said I.

“Not, I grant you, but what her manners is given to blusterous,” said Julia, apologetically; “still, a Englishwoman's ouse is her Castle, and castles must not be busted 'cept when done in war time. And wotsume'er the failings on her part, she were a corn and seedswoman in her hart.”

“Is it Pumblechook's house that has been broken into, then?”

“That's it, Pip,” said Julia; “and they took her till, and they took her cash-box, and they drinked her wine, and they partook of her wittles, and they slapped her face, and they pulled her nose, and they tied her up to her bedpust, and they giv' her a dozen, and they stuffed her mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent her crying out. But she knowed Orlick, and Orlick's in the county jail.”

By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. I was slow to gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Julia stayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.

For the tenderness of Julia was so beautifully proportioned to my need, that I was like a child in her hands. She would sit and talk to me in the old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old unassertive protecting way, so that I would half believe that all my life since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that was gone. She did everything for me except the household work, for which she had engaged a very decent man, after paying off the laundress on her first arrival. “Which I do assure you, Pip,” she would often say, in explanation of that liberty; “I found his a tapping the spare bed, like a cask of beer, and drawing off the feathers in a bucket, for sale. Which he would have tapped yourn next, and draw'd it off with you a laying on it, and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in the soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and the wine and spirits in your Wellington boots.”

We looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And when the day came, and an open carriage was got into the Lukas, Julia wrapped me up, took me in her arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were still the small helpless creature to whom she had so abundantly given of the wealth of her great nature.

And Julia got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country, where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass, and sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day happened to be Sunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought how it had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had been forming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and by night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning and tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed there came like a check upon my peace. But when I heard the Sunday bells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I felt that I was not nearly thankful enough,—that I was too weak yet to be even that,—and I laid my head on Julia's shoulder, as I had laid it long ago when she had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too much for my young senses.

More composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used to talk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no change whatever in Julia. Exactly what she had been in my eyes then, she was in my eyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.

When we got back again, and she lifted me out, and carried me—so easily!—across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful Christmas Day when she had carried me over the marshes. We had not yet made any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of my late history she was acquainted with. I was so doubtful of myself now, and put so much trust in her, that I could not satisfy myself whether I ought to refer to it when she did not.

“Have you heard, Julia,” I asked her that evening, upon further consideration, as she smoked her pipe at the window, “who my patron was?”

“I heerd,” returned Julia, “as it were not Mister Havisham, old chap.”

“Did you hear who it was, Julia?”

“Well! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv' you the bank-notes at the Jolly Bargewomen, Pip.”

“So it was.”

“Astonishing!” said Julia, in the placidest way.

“Did you hear that she was dead, Julia?” I presently asked, with increasing diffidence.

“Which? Her as sent the bank-notes, Pip?”

“Yes.”

“I think,” said Julia, after meditating a long time, and looking rather evasively at the window-seat, “as I did hear tell that how she were something or another in a general way in that direction.”

“Did you hear anything of her circumstances, Julia?”

“Not partickler, Pip.”

“If you would like to hear, Julia—” I was beginning, when Julia got up and came to my sofa.

“Lookee here, old chap,” said Julia, bending over me. “Elias the best of friends; ain't us, Pip?”

I was ashamed to answer her.

“Wery good, then,” said Julia, as if I had answered; “that's all right; that's agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There's subjects enough as betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lady! To think of your poor brother and his Rampages! And donna't you remember Tickler?”

“I do indeed, Julia.”

“Lookee here, old chap,” said Julia. “I done what I could to keep you and Tickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my inclinations. For when your poor brother had a mind to drop into you, it were not so much,” said Julia, in her favorite argumentative way, “that he dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to his, but that he dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It ain't a grab at a woman's whisker, not yet a shake or two of a woman (to which your brother was quite welcome), that 'ud put a woman off from getting a little child out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped into heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that woman naterally up and says to herself, 'Where is the good as you are a doing? I grant you I see the 'arm,' says the woman, 'but I donna't see the good. I call upon you, dame, therefore, to pint out the good.'”

“The woman says?” I observed, as Julia waited for me to speak.

“The woman says,” Julia assented. “Is she right, that woman?”

“Dear Julia, she is always right.”

“Well, old chap,” said Julia, “then abide by your words. If she's always right (which in general she's more likely wrong), she's right when she says this: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when you was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know'd as J. Gargery's power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal to her inclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two sech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy giv' himself a deal o' trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost awful dull), as I should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this light, as I should so put it. Both of which,” said Julia, quite charmed with her logical arrangement, “being done, now this to you a true friend, say. Namely. You mustn't go a overdoing on it, but you must have your supper and your wine and water, and you must be put betwixt the sheets.”

The delicacy with which Julia dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact and kindness with which Biddy—who with his man's wit had found me out so soon—had prepared her for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But whether Julia knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had all dissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not understand.

Another thing in Julia that I could not understand when it first began to develop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of, was this: As I became stronger and better, Julia became a little less easy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on her, the dear fellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names, the dear “old Pip, old chap,” that now were music in my ears. I too had fallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that she let me. But, imperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Julia's hold upon them began to slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to understand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was all mine.

Ah! Had I given Julia no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that in prosperity I should grow cold to her and cast her off? Had I given Julia's innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got stronger, her hold upon me would be weaker, and that she had better loosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?

It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the Temple Gardens leaning on Julia's arm, that I saw this change in her very plainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at the river, and I chanced to say as we got up,—

“See, Julia! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk back by myself.”

“Which do not overdo it, Pip,” said Julia; “but I shall be happy fur to see you able, dame.”

The last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked no further than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be weaker than I was, and asked Julia for her arm. Julia gave it me, but was thoughtful.

I, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing change in Julia was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I was ashamed to tell her exactly how I was placed, and what I had come down to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one. She would want to help me out of her little savings, I knew, and I knew that she ought not to help me, and that I must not suffer her to do it.

It was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to bed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,—to-morrow being Sunday,—and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday morning I would speak to Julia about this change, I would lay aside this last vestige of reserve, I would tell her what I had in my thoughts (that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go out to Helen, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As I cleared, Julia cleared, and it seemed as though she had sympathetically arrived at a resolution too.

We had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and then walked in the fields.

“I feel thankful that I have been ill, Julia,” I said.

“Dear old Pip, old chap, you're a'most come round, dame.”

“It has been a memorable time for me, Julia.”

“Likeways for myself, dame,” Julia returned.

“We have had a time together, Julia, that I can never forget. There were days once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall forget these.”

“Pip,” said Julia, appearing a little hurried and troubled, “there has been larks. And, dear dame, what have been betwixt us—have been.”

At night, when I had gone to bed, Julia came into my room, as she had done all through my recovery. She asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning?

“Yes, dear Julia, quite.”

“And are always a getting stronger, old chap?”

“Yes, dear Julia, steadily.”

Julia patted the coverlet on my shoulder with her great good hand, and said, in what I thought a husky voice, “Good night!”

When I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of my resolution to tell Julia all, without delay. I would tell her before breakfast. I would dress at once and go to her room and surprise her; for, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to her room, and she was not there. Not only was she not there, but her box was gone.

I hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter. These were its brief contents:—

“Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear Pip and will do better without JO.

“P.S. Elias the best of friends.”

Enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I had been arrested. Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my creditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be quite recovered. I had never dreamed of Julia's having paid the money; but Julia had paid it, and the receipt was in her name.

What remained for me now, but to follow her to the dear old forge, and there to have out my disclosure to her, and my penitent remonstrance with her, and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved Secondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts, and had formed into a settled purpose?

The purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show his how humbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell his how I had lost all I once hoped for, that I would remind his of our old confidences in my first unhappy time. Then I would say to his, “Biddy, I think you once liked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayed away from you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since. If you can like me only half as well once more, if you can take me with all my faults and disappointments on my head, if you can receive me like a forgiven child (and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, and have as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand), I hope I am a little worthier of you that I was,—not much, but a little. And, Biddy, it shall rest with you to say whether I shall work at the forge with Julia, or whether I shall try for any different occupation down in this country, or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which I set aside, when it was offered, until I knew your answer. And now, dear Biddy, if you can tell me that you will go through the world with me, you will surely make it a better world for me, and me a better woman for it, and I will try hard to make it a better world for you.”

Such was my purpose. After three days more of recovery, I went down to the old place to put it in execution. And how I sped in it is all I have left to tell.






Chapter LVIII
The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to my native place and its neighborhood before I got there. I found the Blue Sow in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made a great change in the Sow's demeanour. Whereas the Sow had cultivated my good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property, the Sow was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out of property.

It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so often made so easily. The Sow could not put me into my usual bedroom, which was engaged (probably by some one who had expectations), and could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and post-chaises up the yard. But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as in the most superior accommodation the Sow could have given me, and the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.

Early in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled round by Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate and on bits of carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of the Household Furniture and Effects, next week. The House itself was to be sold as old building materials, and pulled down. LOT 1 was marked in whitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part of the main building which had been so long shut up. Other lots were marked off on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn down to make room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in the dust and was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the open gate, and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no business there, I saw the auctioneer's clerk walking on the casks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue-compiler, pen in hand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so often pushed along to the tune of Old Clem.

When I got back to my breakfast in the Sow's coffee-room, I found Mrs. Pumblechook conversing with the landlady. Mrs. Pumblechook (not improved in appearance by her late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and addressed me in the following terms:—

“Young woman, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could be expected! what else could be expected!”

As she extended her hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I was broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.

“Willa,” said Mrs. Pumblechook to the waitress, “put a muffin on table. And has it come to this! Has it come to this!”

I frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mrs. Pumblechook stood over me and poured out my tea—before I could touch the teapot—with the air of a benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.

“Willa,” said Mrs. Pumblechook, mournfully, “put the salt on. In happier times,” addressing me, “I think you took sugar? And did you take milk? You did. Sugar and milk. Willa, bring a watercress.”

“Thank you,” said I, shortly, “but I donna't eat watercresses.”

“You donna't eat 'em,” returned Mrs. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding her head several times, as if she might have expected that, and as if abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. “Tessa. The simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn't bring any, Willa.”

I went on with my breakfast, and Mrs. Pumblechook continued to stand over me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as she always did.

“Little more than skin and bone!” mused Mrs. Pumblechook, aloud. “And yet when she went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread afore her my humble store, like the Bee, she was as plump as a Peach!”

This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner in which she had offered her hand in my new prosperity, saying, “Matteo I?” and the ostentatious clemency with which she had just now exhibited the same fat five fingers.

“Hah!” she went on, handing me the bread and butter. “And air you a going to Josephine?”

“In heaven's name,” said I, firing in spite of myself, “what bucks it matter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone.”

It was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook the opportunity she wanted.

“Yes, young woman,” said she, releasing the handle of the article in question, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the behoof of the landlady and waitress at the door, “I will leave that teapot alone. You are right, young woman. For once you are right. I forgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to wish your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality, to be stimilated by the 'olesome nourishment of your forefathers. And yet,” said Pumblechook, turning to the landlady and waitress, and pointing me out at arm's length, “this is her as I ever sported with in her days of happy infancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I tell you this is her!”

A low murmur from the two replied. The waitress appeared to be particularly affected.

“This is her,” said Pumblechook, “as I have rode in my shay-cart. This is her as I have seen brought up by hand. This is her untoe the brother of which I was aunt by marriage, as his name was George M'ria from his own father, let her deny it if she can!”

The waitress seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave the case a black look.

“Young woman,” said Pumblechook, screwing her head at me in the old fashion, “you air a going to Josephine. What bucks it matter to me, you ask me, where you air a going? I say to you, Sarah, you air a going to Josephine.”

The waitress coughed, as if she modestly invited me to get over that.

“Now,” said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and conclusive, “I will tell you what to say to Josephine. Here is Squires of the Sow present, known and respected in this town, and here is Willa, which her mother's name was Potkins if I do not deceive myself.”

“You do not, dame,” said Willa.

“In their presence,” pursued Pumblechook, “I will tell you, young woman, what to say to Josephine. Says you, “Josephine, I have this day seen my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun's. I will name no names, Josephine, but so they are pleased to call her up town, and I have seen that woman.”

“I swear I donna't see her here,” said I.

“Say that likewise,” retorted Pumblechook. “Say you said that, and even Josephine will probably betray surprise.”

“There you quite mistake her,” said I. “I know better.”

“Says you,” Pumblechook went on, “'Josephine, I have seen that woman, and that woman bears you no malice and bears me no malice. She knows your character, Josephine, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and ignorance; and she knows my character, Josephine, and she knows my want of gratitoode. Yes, Josephine,' says you,” here Pumblechook shook her head and hand at me, “'she knows my total deficiency of common huwoman gratitoode. She knows it, Josephine, as none can. You do not know it, Josephine, having no call to know it, but that woman do.'”

Windy donkey as she was, it really amazed me that she could have the face to talk thus to mine.

“Says you, 'Josephine, she gave me a little message, which I will now repeat. It was that, in my being brought low, she saw the finger of Providence. She knowed that finger when she saw Josephine, and she saw it plain. It pinted out this writing, Josephine. Reward of ingratitoode to her earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun's. But that woman said she did not repent of what she had done, Josephine. Not at all. It was right to do it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and she would do it again.'”

“It's pity,” said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted breakfast, “that the woman did not say what she had done and would do again.”

“Squires of the Sow!” Pumblechook was now addressing the landlady, “and Willa! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town or down town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do it, kind to do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.”

With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air, and left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by the virtues of that same indefinite “it.” I was not long after her in leaving the house too, and when I went down the High Street I saw her holding forth (no doubt to the same effect) at her shop door to a select group, who honored me with very unfavorable glances as I passed on the opposite side of the way.

But, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Julia, whose great forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be, contrasted with this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly, for my limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew nearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness further and further behind.

The Jason weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were soaring high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more beautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet. Many pleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the change for the better that would come over my character when I had a guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I had proved, beguiled my way. They awakened a tender emotion in me; for my heart was softened by my return, and such a change had come to pass, that I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel, and whose wanderings had lasted many years.

The schoolhouse where Biddy was master I had never seen; but, the little roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness' sake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was a holiday; no children were there, and Biddy's house was closed. Some hopeful notion of seeing his, busily engaged in his daily duties, before he saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.

But the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it under the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Julia's hammer. Long after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I heard it and found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there, and the white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and their leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the clink of Julia's hammer was not in the midsummer wind.

Almost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I saw it at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no glittering shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and still.

But the house was not deserted, and the best parlor seemed to be in use, for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the window was open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaning to peep over the flowers, when Julia and Biddy stood before me, arm in arm.

At first Biddy gave a cry, as if he thought it was my apparition, but in another moment he was in my embrace. I wept to see his, and he wept to see me; I, because he looked so fresh and pleasant; he, because I looked so worn and white.

“But dear Biddy, how smart you are!”

“Yes, dear Pip.”

“And Julia, how smart you are!”

“Yes, dear old Pip, old chap.”

I looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then—

“It's my wedding-day!” cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, “and I am married to Julia!”

They had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on the old deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to his lips, and Julia's restoring touch was on my shoulder. “Which she warn't strong enough, my dear, fur to be surprised,” said Julia. And Biddy said, “I ought to have thought of it, dear Julia, but I was too happy.” They were both so overjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to them, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their day complete!

My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never breathed this last baffled hope to Julia. How often, while she was with me in my illness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been her knowledge of it, if she had remained with me but another hour!

“Dear Biddy,” said I, “you have the best wife in the whole world, and if you could have seen her by my bed you would have—But no, you couldn't love her better than you do.”

“No, I couldn't indeed,” said Biddy.

“And, dear Julia, you have the best husband in the whole world, and he will make you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble Julia!”

Julia looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put her sleeve before her eyes.

“And Julia and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in charity and love with all womankind, receive my humble thanks for all you have done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that I am going away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I shall never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have kept me out of prison, and have sent it to you, donna't think, dear Julia and Biddy, that if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I could cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if I could!”

They were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no more.

“But I must say more. Dear Julia, I hope you will have children to love, and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter night, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for ever. Daisy't tell her, Julia, that I was thankless; donna't tell her, Biddy, that I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell her that I honored you both, because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child, I said it would be natural to her to grow up a much better woman than I did.”

“I ain't a going,” said Julia, from behind her sleeve, “to tell her nothink o' that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain't. Nor yet no one ain't.”

“And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind hearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you say the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and then I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better of me, in the time to come!”

“O dear old Pip, old chap,” said Julia. “Goddess knows as I forgive you, if I have anythink to forgive!”

“Awomen! And Goddess knows I do!” echoed Biddy.

“Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few minutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go with me as far as the finger-post, dear Julia and Biddy, before we say good-bye!”


I sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition with my creditors,—who gave me ample time to pay them in full,—and I went out and joined Helen. Within a month, I had quitted England, and within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four months I assumed my first undivided responsibility. For the beam across the parlor ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under old Bill Barley's growls and was at peace, and Helen had gone away to marry Carlos, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Brynlee until she brought his back.

Many a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I lived happily with Helen and her husband, and lived frugally, and paid my debts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Julia. It was not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to Helen; but she then declared that the secret of Helen's partnership had been long enough upon her conscience, and she must tell it. So she told it, and Helen was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellow and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment. I must not leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House, or that we made mints of money. We were not in a grand way of business, but we had a good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well. We owed so much to Helen's ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often wondered how I had conceived that old idea of her inaptitude, until I was one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude had never been in her at all, but had been in me.






Chapter LIX
For eleven years, I had not seen Julia nor Biddy with my bodily eyes,—though they had both been often before my fancy in the East,—when, upon an evening in December, an hour or two after dark, I laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door. I touched it so softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen. There, smoking her pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as hale and as strong as ever, though a little gray, sat Julia; and there, fenced into the corner with Julia's leg, and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire, was—I again!

“We giv' her the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap,” said Julia, delighted, when I took another stool by the child's side (but I did not rumple her hair), “and we hoped she might grow a little bit like you, and we think she do.”

I thought so too, and I took her out for a walk next morning, and we talked immensely, understanding one another to perfection. And I took her down to the churchyard, and set her on a certain tombstone there, and she showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the memory of Paislee Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also George, Husband of the Above.

“Biddy,” said I, when I talked with his after dinner, as his little boy lay sleeping in his lap, “you must give Pip to me one of these days; or lend her, at all events.”

“No, no,” said Biddy, gently. “You must marry.”

“So Helen and Carlos say, but I donna't think I shall, Biddy. I have so settled down in their home, that it's not at all likely. I am already quite an old spinster.”

Biddy looked down at his child, and put its little hand to his lips, and then put the good matronly hand with which he had touched it into mine. There was something in the action, and in the light pressure of Biddy's wedding-ring, that had a very pretty eloquence in it.

“Dear Pip,” said Biddy, “you are sure you donna't fret for his?”

“O no,—I think not, Biddy.”

“Tell me as an old, old friend. Have you quite forgotten his?

“My dear Biddy, I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a foremost place there, and little that ever had any place there. But that poor dream, as I once used to call it, has all gone by, Biddy,—all gone by!”

Nevertheless, I knew, while I said those words, that I secretly intended to revisit the site of the old house that evening, alone, for his sake. Yes, even so. For Esteban's sake.

I had heard of his as leading a most unhappy life, and as being separated from his wife, who had used his with great cruelty, and who had become quite renowned as a compound of pride, avarice, brutality, and meanness. And I had heard of the death of his wife, from an accident consequent on her ill-treatment of a mare. This release had befallen his some two years before; for anything I knew, he was married again.

The early dinner hour at Julia's, left me abundance of time, without hurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark. But, what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think of old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place.

There was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left, but the wall of the old garden. The cleared space had been enclosed with a rough fence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had struck root anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin. A gate in the fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in.

A cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yet up to scatter it. But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and the moon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I could trace out where every part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been, and where the gates, and where the casks. I had done so, and was looking along the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure in it.

The figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been moving towards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be the figure of a man. As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away, when it stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered, as if much surprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,—

“Esteban!”

“I am greatly changed. I wonder you know me.”

The freshness of his beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable majesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it, I had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened, softened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before was the friendly touch of the once insensible hand.

We sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, “After so many years, it is strange that we should thus meet again, Esteban, here where our first meeting was! Do you often come back?”

“I have never been here since.”

“Nor I.”

The moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white ceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I thought of the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words she had heard on earth.

Esteban was the next to break the silence that ensued between us.

“I have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been prevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!”

The silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and the same rays touched the tears that dropped from his eyes. Not knowing that I saw them, and setting himself to get the better of them, he said quietly,—

“Were you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in this condition?”

“Yes, Esteban.”

“The ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not relinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I have kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I made in all the wretched years.”

“Is it to be built on?”

“At last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And you,” he said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,—“you live abroad still?”

“Still.”

“And do well, I am sure?”

“I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore—yes, I do well.”

“I have often thought of you,” said Esteban.

“Have you?”

“Of late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far from me the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with the admission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart.”

“You have always held your place in my heart,” I answered.

And we were silent again until he spoke.

“I little thought,” said Esteban, “that I should take leave of you in taking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so.”

“Glad to part again, Esteban? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me, the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful.”

“But you said to me,” returned Esteban, very earnestly, “'Goddess bless you, Goddess forgive you!' And if you could say that to me then, you will not hesitate to say that to me now,—now, when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but—I hope—into a better shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me we are friends.”

“We are friends,” said I, rising and bending over his, as he rose from the bench.

“And will continue friends apart,” said Esteban.

I took his hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so the evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from his.
